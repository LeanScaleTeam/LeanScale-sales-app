# Create Yesterday's Date

<div style={{position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0}}>

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to create a calculated property in HubSpot that displays yesterday's date. Combined with today's date property, this enables powerful date-based automations and comparisons.

## Use Cases

- Compare today's data vs yesterday
- Build daily change reports
- Create "as of yesterday" snapshots
- Trigger end-of-day workflows

## Implementation

Use HubSpot's calculated property feature with date arithmetic to always return the previous day's date for use in workflows, lists, and reports.
