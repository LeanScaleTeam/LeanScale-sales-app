### Task List: (Event ROI) 1. Strategy & Lead Capture
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Audit Current Event Operations | 2.5h | Assess the client's current approach to physical events, including how leads are captured, processed, and measured.

End state: Documented event goals framework with primary and secondary metrics for different event types.<br /><br />• Define primary event objectives by event type (trade show vs. conference vs. field event)<br />• Establish lead generation targets (MQLs, qualified conversations, demos booked)<br />• Set pipeline influence metrics (pipeline created within 30/60/90 days)<br />• Define revenue attribution methodology (first-touch, multi-touch, or influenced)<br />• Create event tier classification system (Tier 1/2/3) based on investment and expected returns<br />• Document expected ROI benchmarks by event tier (industry average is 5:1 for enterprise B2B) |
| 3. Design Standard Event Process Workflows | 3h | Create repeatable, documented workflows for the full event lifecycle following the 40-20-40 framework (pre-event, during event, post-event). End state: Event SOP document with checklists and process maps for each phase.<br /><br />• Document pre-event planning checklist (6-8 weeks before): goals, target accounts, messaging<br />• Create on-site lead capture protocol: who captures, what data, how qualified<br />• Design post-event follow-up workflow: timelines, ownership, escalation paths<br />• Define lead qualification criteria specific to events (BANT, engagement level)<br />• Create lead routing rules for post-event handoff to sales<br />• Build event briefing template for sales team pre-event |
| 4. Select and Configure Lead Capture Tools | 3h | Evaluate and implement lead capture technology that integrates with the client's CRM and MAP. End state: Lead capture solution selected, configured, and ready for testing.<br /><br />• Assess current lead capture tools (badge scanners, event apps, QR codes)<br />• Evaluate options based on CRM compatibility: native integrations with Salesforce/HubSpot<br />• Consider tools like Cvent, Bizzabo, momencio, or built-in scanner apps<br />• Configure lead capture forms with required fields (contact info, qualification questions)<br />• Set up QR code or smart badge scanning capabilities<br />• Test data capture with sample leads to verify field mapping |
| 5. Build CRM Campaign Structure for Events | 3h | Create standardized CRM campaign structure that will house event leads and enable attribution. End state: Campaign templates and hierarchy set up in CRM for consistent event tracking.<br /><br />• Design campaign hierarchy (Parent campaign for event, child campaigns for sessions/activities)<br />• Create campaign member statuses reflecting event engagement (Registered, Attended, Met with Rep, Demo Requested)<br />• Build campaign templates that can be cloned for each new event<br />• Configure campaign attribution settings (first-touch, influenced, multi-touch)<br />• Set up UTM parameter conventions for event-related digital touchpoints<br />• Document campaign naming conventions for consistency |
| 6. Configure Lead Flow Automation | 4h | Set up automated workflows to move leads from capture tools into CRM/MAP with proper routing and enrichment. End state: Same-day automated lead flow from event capture to CRM with assignment rules.<br /><br />• Build integration between lead capture tool and CRM (API, native, or Zapier)<br />• Configure automatic lead creation with event campaign membership<br />• Set up lead enrichment triggers (ZoomInfo, Clearbit, or similar)<br />• Create lead routing rules based on territory, account ownership, or round-robin<br />• Build automated lead assignment notifications to sales reps<br />• Configure same-day follow-up task creation for assigned reps<br />• Test end-to-end flow with sample data before first event |

### Task List: (Event ROI) 2. Reporting & Enablement
**Contains:** Parts 3-4

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 7. Define ROI Calculation Methodology | 2.5h | Establish the specific formulas and attribution logic that will be used to calculate event ROI consistently. End state: Documented ROI methodology with clear definitions and calculation examples.<br /><br />• Define event cost tracking categories (booth, travel, sponsorship, swag, staff time)<br />• Establish revenue attribution windows (30, 60, 90-day and 6-month tracking)<br />• Choose attribution model (first-touch, influenced, or blended)<br />• Create pipeline influence calculation logic (opportunity touched by event contact)<br />• Define "event-sourced" vs. "event-influenced" pipeline distinction<br />• Document ROI formula: (Pipeline Influenced - Event Cost) / Event Cost |
| 8. Build Event Performance Dashboards | 4h | Create CRM/BI dashboards that visualize event performance, lead flow, and ROI metrics. End state: Live dashboards accessible to marketing and sales leadership showing event ROI.<br /><br />• Build lead metrics dashboard: leads captured, MQL conversion, SQL conversion by event<br />• Create pipeline dashboard: opportunities created, pipeline value, by event and timeframe<br />• Design ROI summary view: cost vs. pipeline, projected vs. actual ROI<br />• Add trend analysis: event performance over time, year-over-year comparison<br />• Include drill-down capability to individual event and lead level<br />• Configure scheduled report delivery to stakeholders (weekly/monthly) |
