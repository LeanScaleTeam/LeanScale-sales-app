## Customer Success Processes

## Onboarding

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Move from founder-led to CSM-led onboarding. Document the process so your first CS hire can run it. Keep it high-touch, but structured.

**What changes at Stabilize:**

- **First CS hire owns onboarding** — Founder steps back but stays accessible for escalations
- **Process gets documented** — Playbook, timeline, milestones, templates
- **Onboarding becomes measurable** — Time to value, completion rates, early churn signals

**Stabilize stage onboarding structure:**

| Phase | Timing | Owner | Key Activities |
|-------|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Handoff** | Day 0 | AE → CSM | Internal handoff call, context transfer |
| **Kickoff** | Week 1 | CSM | Customer kickoff, goals alignment, success criteria |
| **Setup** | Week 1-2 | CSM + Customer | Configuration, data import, integrations |
| **Training** | Week 2-3 | CSM | User training, workflow setup |
| **First value** | Week 3-4 | CSM | Validate they've achieved initial goal |
| **Transition** | Week 4+ | CSM | Move to ongoing success cadence |

**What to document:**

- **Kickoff deck** — Standard presentation for first meeting
- **Onboarding checklist** — Steps, owners, completion criteria
- **Training materials** — Videos, docs, walkthroughs for common use cases
- **Success criteria template** — How to define and track success with customer

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't throw customers to the first CS hire without documentation — they'll fail
- Don't assume onboarding ends at go-live — first value is the milestone
- Don't skip the handoff — every customer needs context transfer

## Success Metrics

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Define what "success" looks like and track it consistently. Not health scoring yet, but real metrics that predict retention.

**What to track at Stabilize:**

| Metric | What It Reveals | How to Track |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Login frequency** | Are they using it? | Product analytics |
| **Feature adoption** | Are they getting full value? | Track key feature usage |
| **Time to first value** | How fast do they succeed? | Measure from go-live to first win |
| **Support volume** | Are they stuck? | Ticket count per customer |
| **NPS/CSAT** | How do they feel? | Survey at 30/60/90 days |

**Defining success criteria:**

Every customer should have documented success criteria:

- **What outcome are they trying to achieve?** (Not features, outcomes)
- **How will we measure it?** (Specific metrics or milestones)
- **By when?** (Timeline for expected value)

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't build elaborate health scores — you don't have enough data to calibrate
- Don't measure everything — pick 3-5 metrics that matter
- Don't let success be undefined — every customer should have documented goals

**Playbook reference:** → Customer Lifecycle (for success metrics framework)

## Product Feedback Collection

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Move from ad-hoc founder conversations to structured collection. You have more customers now — need to capture, categorize, and prioritize systematically.

**Feedback collection at Stabilize:**

| Channel | Frequency | Owner | What You Learn |
|---------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **QBRs** | Quarterly | CSM | Strategic needs, satisfaction |
| **Support tickets** | Ongoing | Support/CS | Pain points, bugs, gaps |
| **NPS surveys** | 30/60/90 days | CS | Sentiment, promoters/detractors |
| **Feature requests** | Ongoing | CS | What customers want to build |
| **Churn interviews** | Every churn | CS/Founder | Why customers leave |

**How to process feedback:**

- **Capture in one place** — Linear, Productboard, or even a spreadsheet
- **Categorize** — Bug, feature request, UX issue, integration, etc.
- **Track frequency** — "5 customers asked for X" is signal
- **Share with product** — Regular sync on customer feedback themes

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't let feedback live in Slack/email — it gets lost
- Don't act on every request — look for patterns
- Don't filter feedback before product sees it — let product hear the raw voice

## Renewal Process

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Move from founder-managed renewals to CSM-owned process. Document the timeline, triggers, and plays for different scenarios.

**Renewal process for Stabilize:**

| Timing | Action | Owner | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| **90 days out** | Renewal identified, health assessed | CSM | Flag at-risk accounts |
| **60 days out** | Renewal conversation started | CSM | Business review, value recap |
| **30 days out** | Terms finalized, contract sent | CSM | Involve AE if expansion opportunity |
| **14 days out** | Follow-up on signature | CSM | Escalate if stuck |
| **0 days** | Renewal complete or churned | CSM | Document outcome and reason |

**Renewal health indicators:**

- **Usage trending up** — Good sign, lead with expansion conversation
- **Usage flat** — Validate they're getting value, address issues
- **Usage declining** — Red flag, intervention needed before renewal conversation
- **No engagement** — Immediate outreach, find out what's happening

**Handling at-risk renewals:**

1. **Identify early** — Don't wait until 30 days out
2. **Understand the issue** — Is it product, value, champion change, budget?
3. **Create a plan** — What would make them renew? Be specific.
4. **Escalate if needed** — Founder/exec involvement for strategic accounts
5. **Document regardless** — Win or lose, capture the learning

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't let renewals sneak up on you — track them proactively
- Don't treat every churn as preventable — some customers were never good fit
- Don't discount without understanding — price isn't usually the real issue

## Expansion & Upsell

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Move from opportunistic to identified. Know which customers are expansion candidates and have a light-touch process for pursuing.

**Expansion signals to track:**

| Signal | What It Means | Action |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Hitting usage limits** | They need more capacity | Upgrade conversation |
| **New use cases** | They want to do more with you | Expansion scoping |
| **New stakeholders** | Other teams interested | Land & expand opportunity |
| **Renewal coming up** | Natural conversation point | Multi-year or expansion deal |
| **Strong NPS/satisfaction** | They like you, might buy more | Reference or expansion ask |

**Expansion process for Stabilize:**

- **CSM identifies opportunities** — Based on signals above
- **CSM qualifies interest** — "We've noticed you're hitting limits. Would you like to discuss options?"
- **AE or CSM closes** — Depending on deal size and complexity
- **Track expansion ARR** — Separate from new logo, measure it

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't push expansion on unhappy customers — fix the issue first
- Don't surprise customers with upsell in every call — build trust
- Don't leave expansion to chance — track signals systematically

---

## Reference & Testimonial Generation

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Build a systematic program. You need more references as your pipeline grows. Proactive asks, tracked assets.

**Reference asset types:**

| Asset Type | Effort | Value | How Many You Need |
|------------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| **Logo permission** | Low | Medium | As many as possible |
| **Quote** | Low | Medium | 5-10 for different personas/use cases |
| **Case study** | Medium | High | 2-3 detailed ones |
| **Reference call** | Low | Very High | 3-5 reliable references |
| **Video testimonial** | Medium-High | High | 1-2 for website/sales |

**How to systematize:**

- **Track reference status** — Field in CRM: willing to reference? what type?
- **Build reference roster** — Know who can speak to what use case
- **Ask at the right time** — After success milestone, positive NPS, renewal
- **Make it easy** — Draft quotes, schedule calls, handle logistics

**Reference program basics:**

- **Every QBR, assess** — Would this customer be a reference? What type?
- **Track requests** — Don't over-use the same 3 customers
- **Thank references** — Recognition, swag, early access to features

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't ask customers who aren't successful — awkward for everyone
- Don't over-use your best references — they'll burn out
- Don't promise references to sales before checking with customers

## Support

**Stage-appropriate approach:** First support hire or first support tool. Move from founder inbox to structured support process.

**Support model for Stabilize:**

| Option | When It Works | Considerations |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **First support hire** | High-touch product, complex onboarding | Most common path |
| **CS handles support** | Low volume, CSMs have capacity | Can overload CSMs |
| **Founder + tool** | Very low volume, simple product | Not sustainable long-term |

**Support infrastructure:**

| Need | Tool Options | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **Ticketing** | Intercom, Zendesk, Front | One place for all requests |
| **Knowledge base** | Notion, Intercom, Help Scout | Self-serve common questions |
| **Live chat** | Intercom, Crisp | Fast response for simple issues |
| **Escalation path** | Internal process | How does support → CS → eng work? |

**Support metrics to track:**

- **First response time** — How fast do you reply?
- **Resolution time** — How fast do you solve?
- **Ticket volume** — Trending up (bad) or down (good)?
- **CSAT on support** — Are customers happy with support experience?

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't let support become a black hole — visibility matters
- Don't expect first support hire to figure it out alone — document process
- Don't ignore support patterns — they're product feedback
