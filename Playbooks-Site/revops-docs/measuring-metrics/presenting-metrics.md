# Presenting Metrics

This guide covers how to effectively present data and metrics in revenue operations contexts. The core message emphasizes that data presentation should drive actionable recommendations rather than simply reporting numbers.

## Purpose of Data in RevOps

Data collection exists to enable strategic recommendations that improve revenue operations - not as an end unto itself.

## Data Maturity Levels

Progress through these stages:

1. **Foundational Data** - Establishing accurate baseline data
2. **Ready Reports** - Creating reports and dashboards
3. **Analytics** - Performing analysis on collected data
4. **Insights** - Deriving insights and making recommendations

## Example Application: Sales Cycle Analysis

When data reveals longer sales cycles in specific industries, the response should not merely report this difference.

**Instead:**
- Investigate root causes
- Propose solutions such as additional training
- Recommend process improvements to accelerate deals

## Best Practices for Data Presentation

### Avoid

- Overwhelming audiences with raw data lacking context
- Presenting findings without business context
- Assuming others will independently derive insights from data

### Do

- Customize presentations for specific audiences (executives, individuals, teams)
- Connect data directly to insights and recommendations
- Use data to initiate cross-team conversations
- Make recommendations even if not immediately implemented

## Core Insight

**You are more familiar with the data and operations.**

This positions analysts as key drivers for translating information into organizational improvements rather than passive reporters of metrics.

Your role is to:
- Synthesize complex data into clear narratives
- Identify patterns others might miss
- Recommend actions based on evidence
- Drive conversations that lead to improvement
