# Interviewing GTM Leaders

## Introduction

**For Marketing Leaders:**
- How did the sales team perform at your previous companies?

## Evaluating Responses

When assessing candidate answers, focus primarily on tone. Look for these key indicators:

- **Respect and Reverence**: Does the candidate speak respectfully about the other department they didn't lead?
- **Shared Ownership**: Do they frame outcomes as team-based, or do they accept responsibility for interdepartmental results?
- **Accountability**: Do they treat it as a separate entity, or acknowledge their role in collective outcomes?

## Red Flags

A significant warning sign emerges when candidates immediately blame or criticize the other team. This behavior suggests potential difficulties collaborating effectively across departmental boundaries.

## Conclusion

Using these targeted questions and thoughtful response analysis helps identify leaders who demonstrate genuine teamwork mentality and recognize themselves as part of a unified go-to-market function rather than isolated departments.
