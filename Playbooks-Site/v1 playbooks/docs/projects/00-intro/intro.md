# LeanScale Playbooks Explained

Welcome to the LeanScale Playbooks library—68 battle-tested GTM execution frameworks designed for B2B tech startups ready to professionalize their revenue operations.

## What Are These Playbooks?

Each playbook is a complete execution guide for a specific GTM project, covering everything from growth modeling and lead routing to CRM migrations and commission planning. These aren't just strategy documents—they're step-by-step procedures with detailed tasks, time estimates, and success metrics.

## How This Library Is Organized

Each project in the sidebar contains two documents:

### 1. Playbook
The strategic overview that explains:
- **What** the project is and why it matters
- **Scope** of what's included and what's not
- **Prerequisites** that need to be in place before starting
- **Success metrics** to measure if the project achieved its goals
- **Common pitfalls** to watch out for

### 2. Project Details / Task List
The detailed execution breakdown that shows:
- **Total hours** required to complete the project
- **Task-by-task breakdown** with time estimates for each step
- **Descriptions** of exactly what gets done at each stage
- **Milestone structure** for larger projects

This is what our team uses when executing projects—you'll see exactly how many hours each task takes and what deliverables come out of each phase.

## How to Use This Library
