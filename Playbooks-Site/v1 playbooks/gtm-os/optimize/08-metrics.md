## Metrics to Measure

**Principle:** Efficiency metrics matter as much as growth metrics. Unit economics become the scorecard. Segment-specific metrics enable optimization.

## Core Metrics at Optimize

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **ARR** | $15-$40M | Overall business health |
| **ARR growth rate** | 40-80% | Growth trajectory |
| **Net Revenue Retention** | >110% | Expansion + retention |
| **Gross Revenue Retention** | >90% | Base business health |
| **CAC** | Segment-specific | Acquisition efficiency |
| **CAC Payback** | Under 18 months | Capital efficiency |
| **LTV:CAC** | >3:1 | Unit economics health |
| **Magic Number** | >0.75 | Sales efficiency |
| **Gross Margin** | >70% | Business model health |
| **Rule of 40** | >40 | Growth + profitability balance |

## Efficiency Metrics (What's New at Optimize)

| **LTV:CAC** | Lifetime value vs acquisition cost | >3:1 |
| **Magic Number** | ARR growth / Sales + Marketing spend | >0.75 |
| **Revenue per Employee** | Organizational efficiency | Increasing |
| **Quota attainment** | Rep productivity | >70% at quota |

## Segment-Specific Metrics

| Metric | Enterprise | Mid-Market | SMB |
|--------|-----------|------------|-----|
| **ACV** | Track | Track | Track |
| **CAC** | Higher acceptable | Moderate | Lower required |
| **Sales cycle** | 6-12 months | 2-4 months | Under 1 month |
| **Win rate** | 25-35% | 20-30% | 15-25% |
| **Expansion rate** | Track | Track | Track |
| **Net retention** | >120% | >110% | >100% |

## Series B/C Benchmarks

| Metric | Good | Great | Top Decile |
|--------|------|-------|-----------|
| **ARR Growth** | 50%+ | 75%+ | 100%+ |
| **Net Retention** | 105%+ | 115%+ | 130%+ |
| **Gross Margin** | 70%+ | 75%+ | 80%+ |
| **Magic Number** | 0.5+ | 0.75+ | 1.0+ |

## What NOT to Measure (Focus Risk)

- **Too many segment cuts** — meaningful sample sizes matter
- **Vanity metrics** — focus on actionable, not impressive
- **Lagging without leading** — need predictive indicators
