### Task List: (Customer Segmentation) 1. Strategy & Data Preparation
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Conduct Stakeholder Discovery Session | 2h | Facilitate a workshop with CS leadership and key stakeholders to understand their segmentation needs and use cases. End state: Documented list of business questions segmentation should answer and how segments will be used operationally.<br /><br />• Schedule 60-90 minute discovery session with VP CS, CS Ops, and 1-2 senior CSMs<br />• Ask: "What questions can't you answer today about your customer base?"<br />• Document current pain points (e.g., "We treat all customers the same," "Can't prioritize book of business")<br />• Identify intended use cases: reporting, playbook triggers, resource allocation, QBR segmentation<br />• List specific business questions segmentation should answer (e.g., "Which industries churn most?")<br />• Confirm who will consume the segments (CS team, leadership, marketing) |
| 2. Audit Current Segmentation State | 2.5h | Assess existing segmentation fields, data quality, and gaps in the CRM. End state: Gap analysis showing what segmentation exists today vs. what's needed.<br /><br />• Pull list of all customer-related fields in CRM (Account object in Salesforce, Company in HubSpot)<br />• Identify existing segmentation fields (industry, company size, region, tier)<br />• Assess data completeness for each field (% populated, % accurate)<br />• Document how current segments are used (if at all) in reporting and workflows<br />• Compare current state to stakeholder needs from discovery session<br />• Create gap analysis: "Have vs. Need" for segmentation criteria |
| 3. Define Segmentation Framework | 3h | Design the segmentation model with specific criteria and segment definitions. End state: Approved segmentation framework document with 3-5 segmentation dimensions and clear criteria for each.<br /><br />• Select 3-5 segmentation dimensions based on discovery (firmographic, behavioral, value-based)<br />• Define specific criteria for each dimension (e.g., Company Size: SMB &lt;100, Mid-Market 100-1000, Enterprise 1000+)<br />• Create segment naming conventions that are intuitive and actionable<br />• Map segments to operational actions (e.g., Enterprise = white-glove service, SMB = tech-touch)<br />• Review framework with stakeholders and get sign-off<br />• Document final segmentation framework with definitions and business rules |
| 4. Identify Data Sources and Enrichment Needs | 2.5h | Map where segmentation data will come from and identify gaps requiring enrichment. End state: Data source map showing which fields come from which systems, plus enrichment plan for gaps.<br /><br />• Map each segmentation field to its data source (CRM, billing, product, enrichment tool)<br />• Identify fields requiring external enrichment (firmographic data from ZoomInfo, Apollo, Clearbit)<br />• Determine product usage data needs (from Customer Success Platform: ChurnZero, Gainsight, Vitally)<br />• Document data sync frequencies and potential latency issues<br />• Create enrichment plan: which tool, which fields, estimated coverage<br />• Get budget approval for any new enrichment tools or credits needed |
| 5. Execute Data Cleanup and Standardization | 3.5h | Clean and standardize existing CRM data to ensure segmentation accuracy. End state: CRM customer data cleaned with standardized values and duplicates merged.<br /><br />• Run duplicate detection report and merge duplicate account records<br />• Standardize industry values using picklist (convert free-text to controlled values)<br />• Normalize company size data (employee count ranges, ARR tiers)<br />• Clean geographic data (country codes, region mapping)<br />• Validate key fields against external data sources where possible<br />• Document data quality improvements (before/after metrics) |
| 6. Enrich Customer Data | 3.5h | Fill data gaps using enrichment tools and manual research. End state: Key segmentation fields populated to 80%+ coverage across customer base.<br /><br />• Configure enrichment tool (Clay, ZoomInfo, Apollo, Clearbit) with customer list<br />• Run bulk enrichment for firmographic fields (employee count, industry, revenue, tech stack)<br />• Review enrichment results and handle non-matches manually<br />• Import enriched data back to CRM with proper field mapping<br />• Validate a sample of enriched records for accuracy<br />• Document final coverage rates for each segmentation field |

### Task List: (Customer Segmentation) 2. Build, Reporting & Enablement
**Contains:** Parts 3-5

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 7. Create Segmentation Fields and Picklists | 3h | Build the required custom fields in the CRM to store segment values. End state: All segmentation fields created with correct data types and picklist values.<br /><br />• Create custom fields for each segmentation dimension (e.g., Customer_Tier__c, Industry_Segment__c)<br />• Define picklist values matching the approved segmentation framework<br />• Set appropriate field-level security (visible to CS and Sales teams)<br />• Add fields to relevant page layouts and record types<br />• Create field descriptions documenting the business rules for each value<br />• Test field creation in sandbox before production deployment |
| 8. Build Automated Segment Assignment Rules | 3.5h | Create automation to assign segments based on defined criteria. End state: Automation running that assigns correct segment values when records are created or updated.<br /><br />• Build assignment logic for each segmentation dimension (formula fields, flows, or automation rules)<br />• For firmographic segments: use employee count and ARR thresholds<br />• For behavioral segments: integrate with CSP data (usage scores, engagement metrics)<br />• For value-based segments: use ARR, expansion potential, strategic importance<br />• Handle edge cases and null values with default assignments<br />• Test automation with sample records covering all segment combinations |
| 9. Run Initial Segment Assignment | 2h | Execute bulk update to assign segments to all existing customers. End state: 100% of active customer accounts have segment values assigned.<br /><br />• Run bulk data update to assign initial segment values to all customer accounts<br />• Use data loader or native mass update for initial population<br />• Validate segment distribution matches expectations (sanity check percentages)<br />• Review outliers and exceptions (large accounts in SMB segment, etc.)<br />• Make manual corrections where data quality issues caused mis-assignment<br />• Document final segment distribution for baseline reporting |
| 10. Create Segment-Based Reports | 3h | Build core reports that slice customer metrics by segment.
