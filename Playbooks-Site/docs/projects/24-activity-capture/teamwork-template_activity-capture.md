### Task List: (Activity Capture) 1. Assessment & Configuration
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Audit Current Activity Logging Completeness | 2h | Assess how much activity data is currently being captured in the CRM vs actual communication volume. End state: Gap analysis document showing what percentage of activities are being missed and which channels are not captured.<br /><br />• Pull activity reports from CRM for last 90 days (emails logged, meetings logged, calls logged)<br />• Request email/calendar volume data from IT or email admin (total emails sent, meetings held)<br />• Compare CRM activity counts to actual communication volume to quantify the gap (e.g., "Only 15% of emails are logged")<br />• Interview 2-3 sales reps to understand current manual logging pain points and time spent on data entry<br />• Document which communication channels are NOT being captured (calls, texts, LinkedIn messages, personal email)<br />• Identify any existing partial activity capture tools in place (e.g., Outreach logging only sequenced emails) |
| 2. Document Tech Stack Requirements | 2h | Map the client's email, calendar, and phone systems to determine tool compatibility requirements. End state: Technical requirements document listing all systems the activity capture tool must integrate with.<br /><br />• Confirm email system (Google Workspace vs Microsoft 365) and admin access availability<br />• Document calendar platform and any shared calendar configurations<br />• Identify phone/dialer tools in use (RingCentral, Dialpad, native CRM dialer, mobile)<br />• List all CRM edition details (Salesforce edition/version, HubSpot tier) to verify API access<br />• Note any security/compliance requirements that may restrict OAuth connections or data sharing<br />• Document user count and license requirements for tool selection |
| 3. Evaluate and Select Activity Capture Tool | 2.5h | Compare activity capture tool options against client's tech stack, requirements, and budget. End state: Tool selected with budget approved and procurement initiated.<br /><br />• Research and shortlist tool options: Einstein Activity Capture (Salesforce native), Clari Capture, Revenue Grid, Affinity, Ebsta<br />• Evaluate each tool on: CRM compatibility, email/calendar platform support, data retention limits, cost per user<br />• Assess data storage model (Einstein stores in separate cloud vs tools that write to standard CRM objects)<br />• Compare reporting capabilities (can activities be used in reports/dashboards or are they display-only?)<br />• Present recommendation with pros/cons to client stakeholders<br />• Get budget approval and begin procurement/trial process |
| 4. Set Up Tool Account and CRM Connection | 2.5h | Create the activity capture tool account and establish the connection to the CRM with proper API permissions. End state: Tool connected to CRM and ready for configuration.<br /><br />• Create activity capture tool account with client as account owner<br />• Connect to Salesforce/HubSpot via OAuth with appropriate admin credentials<br />• Grant required API permissions (read/write activities, contacts, accounts, opportunities)<br />• Verify connection status in tool dashboard and confirm bi-directional communication<br />• Document admin credentials and access details for client handoff<br />• Add LeanScale team as temporary admins for configuration period |
| 5. Configure Email Sync Settings | 2h | Configure email synchronization between activity capture tool and CRM with appropriate visibility and filtering rules. End state: Email sync active with correct visibility levels and domain restrictions.<br /><br />• Set sync direction (one-way from email to CRM recommended for most use cases)<br />• Define visibility levels (private to rep only vs shared with team/managers) based on client policy<br />• Configure email domain restrictions to exclude personal domains (gmail.com, yahoo.com, hotmail.com)<br />• Set up internal domain exclusions to prevent logging of internal company emails<br />• Configure organizational defaults and lock settings to prevent rep-level overrides<br />• Test with 3-5 sample emails across different scenarios (new lead, existing customer, internal) and verify they appear correctly in CRM |
| 6. Configure Calendar Sync Settings | 2h | Set up calendar event synchronization to capture meetings automatically. End state: Calendar events syncing to CRM with correct meeting type classification and attendee linking.<br /><br />• Connect calendar (Google Calendar or Outlook) with appropriate permissions<br />• Define which meeting types to capture (external meetings only vs all meetings)<br />• Configure handling rules for internal vs external meetings based on attendee domains<br />• Set up meeting type classification rules (Demo, Discovery Call, Follow-up, etc.) if tool supports<br />• Configure attendee matching to link meetings to correct Contact/Lead records<br />• Test with sample calendar events and verify they appear on correct CRM records |
| 7. Configure Call Activity Capture | 2h | Set up call activity capture for phone/dialer systems if client uses supported tools. End state: Call activities logging to CRM with duration and outcome tracking.<br /><br />• Identify if client's dialer/phone system supports activity capture integration<br />• Configure call logging connection (native CRM dialer, RingCentral, Dialpad integration)<br />• Set up call outcome picklist values to standardize call disposition tracking<br />• Configure call duration capture and any call recording linkage (separate from Conversation Intelligence)<br />• Test call logging with sample calls and verify data appears on correct records<br />• Document any manual call logging still required for unsupported channels (mobile, desk phones) |

### Task List: (Activity Capture) 2. Integration & Enablement
**Contains:** Parts 3-4

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 8. Map Activity Fields to CRM Objects | 3h | Configure how captured activities link to CRM records (Contacts, Accounts, Leads, Opportunities). End state: Activities correctly associating to all relevant CRM records based on email addresses and domains.<br /><br />• Configure contact matching logic (email address to Contact/Lead match)<br />• Set up domain-to-account mapping for linking activities to Account records<br />• Configure Opportunity association rules (activities on Contacts linked to open Opportunities)<br />• Test edge cases: new leads without existing accounts, contacts at multiple companies, shared email domains<br />• Set up duplicate handling rules to prevent duplicate activity records<br />• Verify activities appear on related lists for Contact, Account, Lead, and Opportunity records |
| 9. Define Activity Type Categorization Schema | 2h | Establish standardized activity types and categorization for consistent reporting. End state: Activity type picklist configured with LeanScale standard or client-approved categories.<br /><br />• Define activity type categories (Email - Outbound, Email - Inbound, Meeting - Demo, Meeting - Discovery, Call - Outbound, etc.)<br />• Configure activity type auto-classification rules where tool supports<br />• Create any required custom fields for activity metadata (meeting outcome, call disposition)<br />• Set up activity subject line standardization or parsing rules<br />• Document the activity categorization schema for training materials<br />• Test categorization with sample activities across all channels |
| 10. Build Activity Monitoring Dashboard | 3h | Create dashboards to monitor activity capture rates and identify sync gaps. End state: Dashboard showing activity capture health metrics for ongoing monitoring.<br /><br />• Build activity volume dashboard showing activities captured by type, user, and time period<br />• Create capture rate comparison report (CRM activities vs expected volume based on user count)<br />• Set up sync error monitoring to identify failed or missing activity syncs<br />• Build user adoption dashboard showing which reps have activity capture enabled/active<br />• Create activity linkage quality report (% of activities linked to accounts, % orphaned)<br />• Configure dashboard sharing with client RevOps team and key stakeholders |
