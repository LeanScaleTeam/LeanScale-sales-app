## Sales Processes

## ICP / Personas

**Stage-appropriate approach:** The ICP hypothesis from Build is now validated (or invalidated). Enough data exists to know what actually works. Time to document clearly so new hires can use it.

**What changes at Stabilize:**

- **Move from hypothesis to definition** — Enough deals have closed to see patterns. Which customers succeeded? Which churned? Why?
- **Document for repeatability** — The ICP needs to be clear enough that a new SDR or AE can qualify leads without asking the founder.
- **Start segmentation thinking** — SMB may behave differently than mid-market. Start tracking, even if segments aren't formalized yet.

**ICP documentation at this stage:**

| Element | What to Document | Why It Matters |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| **Industry/Vertical** | Top 2-3 verticals with highest win rate | Focus outbound, prioritize inbound |
| **Company Size** | Employee/revenue ranges that work | Stop wasting time on bad-fit companies |
| **Pain Signals** | Observable problems (not just demographics) | Better qualification |
| **Buyer Persona** | Title, role, what they care about | Message to the right person |
| **Anti-ICP** | Who NOT to sell to | Save time, reduce churn |

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't keep the ICP in your head — new hires need it written
- Don't over-segment — not enough volume for complex segmentation yet
- Don't ignore churn patterns — churned customers reveal who wasn't actually ICP

## Qualification

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Move from informal questions to a defined framework. Your reps need clear criteria to work from. But keep it simple — 5-7 criteria max.

**Why formal qualification matters now:**

- Founder intuition doesn't transfer — reps need explicit criteria
- More leads than can be handled — prioritization matters
- Bad-fit deals waste everyone's time and hurt morale

**Stabilize stage qualification framework:**

Pick a methodology and customize it. Common options:

| Framework | Best For | Keep in Mind |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **BANT** | SMB, transactional | Simple but shallow — easy for new reps |
| **MEDDIC** | Mid-market, enterprise | More rigorous, requires training |
| **SPICED** | Consultative sales | Good for complex products |

**Minimum qualification criteria to define:**

1. **Problem fit** — Do they have the specific pain your product solves?
2. **Budget** — Can they pay your price? (Not "do they have budget" but "at our price point")
3. **Authority** — Are we talking to someone who can decide or influence?
4. **Timeline** — Is there urgency? What's driving it?
5. **Fit** — Are they in our ICP? Would they be a good customer?

**How to use qualification:**

- **For SDRs** — Qualification is about whether to pass to AE, not about closing
- **For AEs** — Qualification continues in discovery, not just first call
- **For pipeline hygiene** — Deals that fail qualification should be disqualified, not left to rot

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't create a 15-point qualification checklist — nobody will use it
- Don't let reps make up their own criteria — inconsistent pipeline
- Don't qualify only on first call — qualification evolves through discovery

## Sales Stage Entry/Exit

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Refine your stages based on real data. Add clear entry/exit criteria so reps know when to move deals. This is foundational for forecasting.

**Why this matters at Stabilize:**

- Pipeline reviews become real — everyone needs to know what stage means
- Forecasting starts — stage probabilities require consistent stage definitions
- Rep coaching — "Why is this in Stage 3?" needs a clear answer

**Stabilize stage sales stages:**

| Stage | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria | Typical Duration |
|-------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Discovery** | Meeting booked | Problem confirmed, stakeholders identified | 1-2 weeks |
| **2. Qualified** | Meets qualification criteria | Champion identified, use case scoped | 1-2 weeks |
| **3. Solution** | Demo completed, solution mapped | Technical validation, pricing discussed | 2-4 weeks |
| **4. Proposal** | Proposal sent | Terms agreed, legal/procurement engaged | 1-3 weeks |
| **5. Commit** | Verbal commitment | Contract signed | 1-2 weeks |
| **6. Closed Won/Lost** | Deal done | — | — |

**Stage discipline:**

- **Clear entry criteria** — Deals shouldn't move forward without meeting criteria
- **Regular stage reviews** — Weekly pipeline review should validate stage accuracy
- **Stage-based forecasting** — Commit deals count differently than discovery deals

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't let reps define their own stages — forecasting accuracy suffers
- Don't have 10 stages — too granular to be useful
- Don't ignore stuck deals — deals in the same stage for 2x typical duration need attention

## Deck and Demo Process

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Create a rep-ready deck and demo flow. Founder deck was custom; rep deck needs to work consistently without founder intuition.

**What changes at Stabilize:**

- **Rep deck vs. founder deck** — Reps need structure, not improvisation. Create a deck they can deliver.
- **Demo script/flow** — Document the flow that works. New reps should follow it.
- **Objection handling** — Capture and share responses to common objections.

**Rep-ready demo structure:**

1. **Opening (5 min)** — Agenda, confirm goals, build rapport
2. **Discovery confirmation (5-10 min)** — Validate understanding from earlier calls
3. **Problem statement (3 min)** — Reflect their pain back, demonstrate understanding
4. **Solution overview (10-15 min)** — High-level, then deep-dive on their use case
5. **Proof points (5 min)** — Case study, demo of specific workflow, ROI
6. **Next steps (5 min)** — Clear ask, timeline, who else needs to see this

**Demo assets to create:**

| Asset | Purpose | Update Cadence |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Master deck** | Standard presentation for reps | Quarterly |
| **Demo environment** | Clean instance with realistic data | Keep current |
| **Objection doc** | Common objections + responses | Ongoing as new ones emerge |
| **Competitive battle cards** | How to position against alternatives | As competitive landscape changes |

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't let every rep create their own deck — inconsistent experience
- Don't demo features without use case context — becomes a feature tour
- Don't assume reps will figure it out — document what works

## Proposal and Quote Generation

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Move from one-off proposals to templates. Still flexible, but structured enough that anyone can send a clean proposal.

**What changes at Stabilize:**

- **Templates, not from-scratch** — Create 1-2 proposal templates for common deal types
- **Standard pricing (mostly)** — Define your pricing structure, even if you flex on edge cases
- **E-signature** — Stop emailing PDFs and chasing signatures

**Proposal structure:**

| Section | What to Include | Why |
|---------|-----------------|-----|
| **Executive summary** | Their problem, why this solution, expected outcome | Decision-maker skim |
| **Proposed solution** | What they get, scope of implementation | Clarity on deliverable |
| **Investment** | Pricing, terms, what's included | No surprises |
| **Timeline** | Start date, milestones, go-live | Sets expectations |
| **Terms** | Payment, contract length, key terms | Reduce back-and-forth |

**Recommended tools:**

| Tool | When to Use | Pricing |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **PandaDoc** | E-sign + proposal templates | Business $49/user/mo (annual) |
| **Qwilr** | More visual proposals | ~$35/user/mo |
| **HubSpot Quotes** | If on HubSpot Sales Hub | Included in Pro |
| **DocuSign** | E-sign only | ~$25/user/mo |

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't still use Google Docs for everything — professionalism matters now
- Don't give every rep pricing authority — define what they can flex
- Don't skip e-signature — chasing signatures is a time sink

---

## CS Handoff

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Formalize the handoff. CS (now a real role) needs structured context. Document what the customer bought, why, and what success looks like.

**Why this matters at Stabilize:**

- **Founder handoffs worked** because founder knew everything. Reps don't.
- **CS can't succeed** if they don't know what the customer was promised.
- **Customer experience drops** when handoffs are sloppy.

**Stabilize stage handoff process:**

1. **Sales completes handoff doc** — Template with key fields (filled, not empty)
2. **Internal handoff call** — 15-30 min between AE and CSM to walk through
3. **Joint kickoff** — AE joins first call with customer, then transitions out

**Handoff documentation (minimum):**

| Field | What to Capture | Why |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| **What they bought** | Products, seats, pricing, contract terms | CS needs to know scope |
| **Why they bought** | Pain points, use cases, success criteria | Context for onboarding |
| **Who's involved** | Champion, decision-maker, end users | Relationship map |
| **Implementation notes** | Technical requirements, integrations, timeline | Smooth onboarding |
| **Risk flags** | Any concerns, tricky dynamics, dependencies | Proactive CS |

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't expect CS to "figure it out" from the CRM — they won't
- Don't skip the internal handoff call — context gets lost
- Don't let AE disappear immediately — transitional presence builds trust

## Territory Design

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Probably still premature. Only consider if you have 2+ reps and need to prevent overlap. Keep it simple.

**When to think about territories at Stabilize:**

- 2+ AEs selling to the same market
- Rep collision on accounts is happening
- Ownership assignment needed (not just conflict management)

**Simple territory approaches for Stabilize:**

| Approach | When It Works | Watch Out For |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Geography** | Clear regional differences, local relationships matter | Uneven market sizes |
| **Named accounts** | Specific target list, ABM-ish | Requires defined account list |
| **Round robin** | Small team, similar market | No ownership, less accountability |
| **Segment (SMB/MM)** | Clear ACV differences, different motions | Requires segment definition |

**What NOT to do at this stage:**

- Don't build complex territory models — they'll change in 6 months
- Don't hire territory ops — overkill
- Don't ignore the problem if reps are fighting over accounts — simple rules prevent conflict

**Playbook reference:** → Sales Territory Design (for later — when you have a team to assign territories to)

---

## Commission Plan Design

**Stage-appropriate approach:** With a rep on the team, a comp plan is needed. Keep it simple. Align incentives with desired behaviors.

**First rep comp plan principles:**

- **Simple over clever** — If they can't explain it in 30 seconds, it's too complex
- **Aligned with what matters** — New logos? Expansion? Retention? Comp for it
- **Achievable with effort** — OTE should be realistic based on pipeline and win rates

**Basic comp structure for Stabilize:**

| Component | Typical Range | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Base** | 50-70% of OTE | Higher base for new market, lower for proven territory |
| **Variable** | 30-50% of OTE | Commission on closed-won |
| **Accelerators** | 1.5-2x above quota | Reward over-performance |
| **Payment timing** | Monthly or quarterly | Keep cash flow manageable |

**First comp plan template:**

- OTE: $X (base + commission at quota)
- Quota: $Y ARR closed (realistic given pipeline)
- Commission rate: Z% of closed ARR
- Accelerator: Above quota, earn 1.5x rate
- Payment: Monthly on collected revenue

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't copy enterprise comp plans — too complex for this stage
- Don't set unattainable quotas — kills morale, signals distrust
- Don't change comp mid-quarter — destroys trust
- Don't comp on things that don't matter — behavior follows incentives

**Ramp and claw-back guidance:**

- **Ramp period:** 3-6 months for first AE. Reduced quota during ramp (50% month 1, 75% month 2, 100% month 3+).
- **Claw-backs:** Keep simple at this stage — claw back only on churns within 90 days. Complex claw-back rules create distrust.
- **Draw vs. commission:** Consider a draw (guaranteed minimum) during ramp, then transition to full commission structure.
