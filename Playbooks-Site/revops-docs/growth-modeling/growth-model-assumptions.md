# Growth Model Assumptions

Understanding the assumptions behind your growth model is critical for accurate planning and forecasting.

## Reverse Engineering the Funnel

Start with revenue targets and work backward to calculate required metrics. Understanding your sales cycle and conversion rates is key. Once you know how many leads it takes to seal a deal, you can reverse engineer the process to pinpoint the number of SQLs, MQLs, and brand awareness required to meet your revenue target.

## Aligning Executive Leadership and Functional Teams

Use the "W method" - asking questions beginning with "W" (What, Why, Who, When, Where) to ensure organizational alignment on growth objectives:

- **What** are our revenue targets?
- **Why** are these targets important?
- **Who** is responsible for each component?
- **When** do we need to achieve milestones?
- **Where** will growth come from?

## Capturing Assumptions

Despite available data, assumptions remain necessary when modeling growth factors:

- **Product launches** - timing and market reception
- **Sales team scaling timelines** - recruitment and ramp periods
- **Market conditions** - competitive landscape and economic factors
- **Conversion rate changes** - improvements from process optimization

Document all assumptions clearly so they can be validated and adjusted over time.

## Continuously Monitoring and Adjusting

Growth modeling requires ongoing attention:

- Remain agile to market changes and competition
- Track progress against the plan regularly
- Update assumptions as new data becomes available
- Communicate changes to all stakeholders
