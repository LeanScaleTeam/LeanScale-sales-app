## Partnerships

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Still largely too early for formal partnerships. Focus on technology integrations that matter to your ICP, not channel programs.

**Partnerships that make sense at Stabilize:**

| Type | When It Works | Investment |
|------|---------------|------------|
| **Technology integrations** | Your product needs to connect to X for ICP to get value | Engineering time |
| **Co-marketing** | Natural audience overlap, low commitment | Marketing coordination |
| **Informal referrals** | You know people who send deals | Relationship maintenance |

**What to avoid at Stabilize:**

- **Formal partner programs** — You don't have the infrastructure to support partners
- **Revenue share agreements** — You don't know your economics well enough
- **Partner managers** — Not enough partner activity to justify
- **Channel deals** — You need to own the customer relationship to learn

**When technology partnerships matter:**

If your ICP says "we only buy tools that integrate with X," you need that integration. Common examples:
- CRM integration (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- SSO/identity (Okta, Azure AD)
- Data/BI (Snowflake, Looker)
- Workflow tools (Slack, Teams)

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't build partnerships before customers ask for them
- Don't sign exclusive agreements — too early to know the right partner
- Don't expect partners to sell for the company — build the motion internally first
