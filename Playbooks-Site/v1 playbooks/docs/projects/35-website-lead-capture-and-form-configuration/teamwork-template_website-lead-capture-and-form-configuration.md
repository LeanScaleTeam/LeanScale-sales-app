### Task List: (Lead Capture) 1. Audit & Form Configuration
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Inventory Existing Website Forms | 1h | Document all current website forms, their locations, field configurations, and submission volumes. End state: Complete form inventory spreadsheet with baseline performance metrics.<br /><br />• Pull list of all forms from MAP (HubSpot/Marketo form library)<br />• Document each form's page location (landing pages, blog sidebars, pricing page, demo request, etc.)<br />• Record current field configurations for each form (name, email, company, phone, etc.)<br />• Note submission volumes and conversion rates for the past 90 days<br />• Flag any forms with unusually low conversion rates (&lt;2%) for priority optimization |
| 2. Map Data Flow from Form to CRM | 1h | Trace the data path from form submission through MAP to CRM, identifying sync failures or data loss points. End state: Data flow diagram with identified gap points documented.<br /><br />• Submit test leads through each major form type<br />• Track data arrival in MAP, field mapping to CRM, and lead record creation<br />• Identify any fields that are not syncing or are mapping incorrectly<br />• Document sync frequency (real-time vs. batched) and any delays<br />• Note any data transformation or enrichment happening between systems |
| 3. Gather Stakeholder Requirements | 1h | Interview Marketing and Sales stakeholders to define required lead data fields and follow-up expectations. End state: Approved requirements document with field list and SLA expectations.<br /><br />• Meet with Sales leadership to define what lead data they need for effective follow-up<br />• Meet with Demand Gen to understand form placement strategy and conversion goals<br />• Document lead routing rules (who gets assigned which leads by segment/territory)<br />• Confirm response time SLAs (target: under 5 minutes for demo requests)<br />• Get sign-off on final field requirements from both teams |
| 4. Assess UTM and Attribution Setup | 0.5h | Review current UTM parameter tracking and identify gaps in lead source attribution. End state: Gap analysis showing what attribution data is being captured vs. lost.<br /><br />• Review UTM taxonomy or campaign naming conventions in use<br />• Test UTM parameter passing from ad platforms through form submissions<br />• Check if hidden fields are capturing UTM values (source, medium, campaign, content, term)<br />• Verify UTM data is persisting to CRM lead records<br />• Document which sources show as "unknown" or "direct" in current reporting |
| 5. Design Form Field Strategy by Funnel Stage | 0.5h | Define field requirements for each form type based on funnel stage and conversion optimization principles. End state: Form field specifications document with progressive profiling plan.<br /><br />• Define TOFU form fields (lead magnet downloads): 2-3 fields max (name, email) targeting 15-25% CVR<br />• Define MOFU form fields (demo requests): 4-5 fields (name, email, company, role) targeting 8-12% CVR<br />• Define BOFU form fields (pricing/trial): 5-7 fields (add phone, company size, use case) targeting 5-8% CVR<br />• Plan progressive profiling rules (what fields to ask on repeat visits)<br />• Document validation rules for each field (email format, phone format, required vs. optional) |
| 6. Build or Reconfigure MAP Forms | 1.5h | Create optimized forms in the MAP with proper field structure, mobile responsiveness, and UX best practices. End state: New/updated forms ready for deployment.<br /><br />• Build forms in MAP using approved field specifications<br />• Configure field validation and error messaging (clear, not frustrating)<br />• Set up multi-step forms for demo requests to boost start rates<br />• Optimize button text (use action-oriented copy like "Get My Demo" vs. generic "Submit")<br />• Ensure mobile responsiveness (large touch-friendly buttons, minimal scrolling)<br />• Add social proof elements where appropriate (G2 rating, customer logos) |
| 7. Configure Hidden Fields for Attribution Tracking | 1h | Set up hidden fields to automatically capture UTM parameters, page URL, and referrer data. End state: All forms capturing full attribution data without user input required.<br /><br />• Add hidden fields for UTM parameters: utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_content, utm_term<br />• Add hidden field for original page URL where form was submitted<br />• Configure hidden field for referrer URL<br />• Set up JavaScript or native MAP functionality to auto-populate hidden fields from URL<br />• Test hidden field population across different traffic sources (direct, organic, paid, email) |
| 8. Set Up MAP-to-CRM Field Mapping | 1h | Configure proper field mapping from MAP forms to CRM lead/contact records with correct data types. End state: Clean data sync with all fields mapping to correct CRM fields.<br /><br />• Map each form field to corresponding CRM lead/contact field<br />• Verify data types match (text, picklist, date, number) to prevent sync errors<br />• Configure picklist value mappings where needed<br />• Set up default values for fields that may be empty<br />• Test end-to-end sync with sample submissions and verify data arrives correctly in CRM |

### Task List: (Lead Capture) 2. Automation & Launch
**Contains:** Parts 3-4

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 9. Create Lead Assignment and Routing Rules | 1h | Configure automated lead assignment based on defined routing rules (territory, segment, round-robin). End state: Leads automatically routing to correct owner upon form submission.<br /><br />• Build lead assignment rules based on stakeholder requirements (geography, company size, industry)<br />• Configure round-robin assignment for demo requests to distribute leads evenly<br />• Set up fallback assignment for leads that don't match any rule<br />• Test assignment logic with sample leads from different segments<br />• Document assignment rules for client reference |
| 10. Configure Submission Notifications for Speed-to-Lead | 0.5h | Set up instant notifications to Sales when high-intent forms are submitted to ensure 5-minute response. End state: Sales notified in real-time for demo and pricing requests.<br /><br />• Configure email notifications to lead owners on demo/pricing form submissions<br />• Set up Slack or Teams notifications for sales team channel (if applicable)<br />• Include key lead data in notification (name, company, form submitted, UTM source)<br />• Test notification delivery timing (target: under 1 minute from submission)<br />• Configure escalation notification if lead not contacted within SLA |
| 11. Build Automated Follow-Up Email Workflows | 1h | Create automated confirmation emails and nurture sequences for form submitters. End state: Leads receiving immediate confirmation and follow-up content automatically.<br /><br />• Build thank-you/confirmation email for each form type with relevant next steps<br />• Set up Day 0 confirmation with download link or meeting booking link as appropriate<br />• Configure nurture sequence: Day 2 (case study/social proof), Day 5 (demo invite if not converted)<br />• Personalize emails based on form data (company name, use case if captured)<br />• Set up exit conditions (remove from nurture if they convert or reply) |
| 12. Execute Cross-Device QA Testing | 0.5h | Test all forms across devices and browsers to verify functionality, mobile experience, and data capture.

| 14. Build Form Performance Dashboard | 1h | Create reporting dashboard to track form submission rates, conversion rates, and lead source breakdown. End state: Live dashboard for ongoing form performance monitoring.<br /><br />• Build dashboard in MAP or BI tool showing form submissions by form name<br />• Add conversion rate metrics (submissions / page views) for each form<br />• Include lead source breakdown from UTM data (paid, organic, email, social, direct)<br />• Set up weekly automated report delivery to Marketing Ops stakeholders<br />• Document where to access dashboard and how to interpret metrics |
