# Stage 5: Platform ($40M+ ARR)

## Overview

## What This Stage Is About

- The organization is no longer a startup — it's an institution that must operate like one
- "More people" no longer equals "more output" — organizational drag, approval chains, and cross-functional misalignment slow everything down
- Success is measured by durability, not just growth — the question shifts from "can we grow?" to "can we sustain?"
- Multi-everything creates complexity: multi-product, multi-geo, multi-segment, multi-motion — each dimension adds coordination cost
- The founders' instincts now compete with institutional processes — governance becomes essential, but governance paralysis is a real risk

## Typical Firmographics

- Revenue: $40M+ ARR
- Headcount: 200+
- Fundraising: Late-Stage / Pre-IPO / Public
- GTM Complexity: Very High — multi-product, multi-geo, partner ecosystems, enterprise + mid-market + SMB motions running in parallel
- Product Complexity: Platform architecture, extensibility, API-first, M&A integration

## Main Goal
 Run a durable company — maintain growth while managing complexity, govern without paralyzing, and ensure the organization can operate independent of any single person.
