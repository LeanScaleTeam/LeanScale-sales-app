## Marketing Processes

## Content Strategy

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Move from founder-only content to systematized production. You need more volume than the founder can produce alone, but you still need founder voice.

**What changes at Stabilize:**

- **Content cadence increases** — From 1-2 pieces/week to multiple pieces/week across channels
- **Content team emerges** — First marketing hire, contractor, or agency takes on production
- **Founder stays involved** — But as subject matter expert, not sole writer

**Content model for Stabilize:**

| Content Type | Frequency | Who Creates | Founder Role |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Thought leadership** | 1-2x/week | Founder or ghostwriter | Ideas, quotes, approval |
| **Product content** | 2-4x/month | Marketing | Review |
| **Case studies** | 1/quarter | Marketing + CS | Customer intros |
| **SEO/educational** | 2-4/month | Marketing or agency | Topic input |

**How to scale content without losing quality:**

- **Create content briefs** — Document the angle, key points, target persona before writing
- **Build a swipe file** — Collect successful content (yours and competitors) for reference
- **Establish review process** — Founder reviews for accuracy/voice, not wordsmithing
- **Repurpose aggressively** — One long piece becomes 5-10 social posts, email excerpts, etc.

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't fully outsource content voice — founder perspective is your edge
- Don't focus on SEO too early — your domain authority is too low for competitive terms
- Don't create content without distribution plan — content nobody sees has no value

## Website & Positioning

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Refine based on what you've learned. Your positioning is now validated by real customers. Update the site to reflect what actually resonates.

**What changes at Stabilize:**

- **Messaging tightens** — You know what works from sales conversations. Update headline/subhead.
- **Social proof expands** — More logos, better case studies, real testimonials
- **Conversion paths clarify** — "Book a demo" vs "Start free trial" — pick your primary motion

**Website improvements for Stabilize:**

| Element | Build Stage | Stabilize Stage |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Headline** | Value prop hypothesis | Proven value prop |
| **Social proof** | Design partner logos | Customer logos + quotes + case studies |
| **Pricing** | Often hidden or "contact us" | Published (if not enterprise) |
| **Content** | Minimal | Blog/resources start appearing |
| **Analytics** | Basic pageviews | Conversion tracking, lead source |

**Positioning work to do:**

- **Document your positioning** — Why you? Why now? What category? (Not just a tagline)
- **Competitive positioning** — How do you talk about alternatives? What's your angle?
- **Validate with customers** — Ask closed-won: "How would you describe us to a colleague?"

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't redesign the whole site every 6 months — incremental improvements
- Don't assume your positioning is done — it will evolve through Scale
- Don't ignore website conversion rates — if demos aren't coming from the site, fix it

## Paid Acquisition

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Small budget experiments become real programs. You have enough data to know what works. Time to scale what's working.

**When paid makes sense at Stabilize:**

- Your ICP is defined and targetable
- You've validated messaging through organic/outbound
- You have sales capacity to handle increased leads
- You're willing to spend $2-5K/month to learn, $5-15K/month to scale

**Paid channels to prioritize:**

| Channel | Best For | Budget Range | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------------|-------|
| **LinkedIn Ads** | B2B targeting, brand awareness | $3-10K/month | Expensive but precise |
| **Google Ads** | Intent capture, bottom of funnel | $2-5K/month | Start with branded/competitor terms |
| **Retargeting** | Nurturing known visitors | $500-1K/month | High ROI, low cost |
| **Paid content** | Distribution for thought leadership | $1-3K/month | LinkedIn Thought Leader ads, sponsored content |

**Paid program basics:**

- **Set up tracking** — UTMs, conversion tracking, CRM integration. Optimization requires measurement.
- **Define success metrics** — CPL is a start, but track pipeline and revenue from paid
- **Weekly optimization** — Review performance, pause underperformers, scale winners
- **Landing pages** — Send paid traffic to dedicated pages, not homepage

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't scale before measurement is in place — tracking leads to revenue is essential
- Don't expect instant results — B2B paid takes months to optimize
- Don't compare your CPL to consumer benchmarks — B2B is expensive
- Don't run paid if your sales team can't follow up — wasted spend

**B2B SaaS CPL benchmarks by channel (2025):**

| Channel | Avg CPL | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **SEO/Retargeting** | ~$31 | Lowest CPL but slower to scale |
| **Email marketing** | ~$53 | Requires existing list |
| **Google Ads** | ~$70 | Good for intent-based capture |
| **Webinars** | ~$72 | Higher quality but time-intensive |
| **Content marketing** | ~$92 | Long-term investment |
| **LinkedIn Ads** | ~$110 | Premium CPL but best B2B targeting |

*Note: B2B SaaS blended CPL typically $200-300 for paid; lower CPL channels often have lower conversion rates.*

## Community & Network Building

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Your founder network got you started. Now build early community around customers and prospects. Still not a formal program.

**What changes at Stabilize:**

- **Expand beyond founder network** — First customers bring their networks
- **Customer community emerges** — Slack/Discord with power users, early adopters
- **Strategic network building** — Targeted relationship-building with partners, influencers

**Community approaches for Stabilize:**

| Approach | Effort | Value | When It Works |
|----------|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Customer Slack/Discord** | Medium | High | If customers want to connect with each other |
| **User group** | Low | Medium | If customers want product input |
| **Industry community** | High | Variable | If you want to become a category leader |

**How to build customer community:**

- **Start small** — Invite 10-20 power users, not everyone
- **Make it valuable** — Early access, direct product input, exclusive content
- **Be present** — Founder or marketing lead should be active
- **Don't over-invest** — Community is high-touch. Scale slowly.

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't build community before customers ask for it
- Don't expect community to replace sales — it's brand and retention, not lead gen
- Don't hire a community manager yet — founders/marketing should own it early

## Event Strategy

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Level up from "attend and speak" to small, strategic events. You have budget for selective sponsorship and hosting small gatherings.

**Event approach for Stabilize:**

| Event Type | Investment | Expected Outcome |
|------------|------------|------------------|
| **Founder speaking** | Low (time) | Brand, credibility |
| **Strategic conferences** | $5-20K sponsorship | Leads, meetings, brand |
| **Small dinners/roundtables** | $1-5K | High-value relationships |
| **Webinars** | Low | Lead gen, nurturing |
| **Host small events** | $2-10K | Brand, customer relationships |

**How to pick events:**

- **Where is your ICP?** — Not where you want to be, where buyers actually go
- **What's the goal?** — Brand awareness vs. lead gen vs. customer success?
- **What's realistic?** — Can you follow up on 50 leads? Can you prep properly?

**Event execution basics:**

- **Pre-event outreach** — Contact known targets before the event
- **Clear CTA** — Demo booking? Meeting? Newsletter signup?
- **Post-event follow-up** — Within 48 hours, while context is fresh

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't sponsor big booths — hard to staff at this size and ROI is questionable
- Don't go to every event — pick 3-4 per year and do them well
- Don't measure by "leads scanned" — measure meetings booked and pipeline generated

## Marketing Ops

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Basic automation and tracking. You need lead routing, email nurture, and conversion tracking. Not a full ops function yet.

**Marketing ops basics for Stabilize:**

| Capability | Why Now | Tool |
|------------|---------|------|
| **Lead routing** | Get leads to the right rep fast | CRM workflow or Chili Piper |
| **Email automation** | Nurture leads at scale | HubSpot, Mailchimp |
| **Form tracking** | Know where leads come from | UTMs + CRM |
| **List management** | Segment for targeting | CRM or MAP |

**What to set up:**

- **Lead capture → CRM** — Forms integrate, leads appear with source
- **Lead routing** — Round robin or territory-based assignment
- **Basic nurture** — 3-5 email sequence for leads not ready to buy
- **Lead scoring (simple)** — Engagement + fit = priority (can be manual at first)

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't build complex scoring models — you don't have enough data
- Don't over-automate — personalization beats automation at this volume
- Don't hire marketing ops yet — founder or marketing generalist can handle basics

**Playbook reference:** → Marketing Automation Platform Implementation (when you're ready for a real MAP)
