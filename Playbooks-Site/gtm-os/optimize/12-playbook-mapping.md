## Playbook Mapping: Optimize Stage

### Essential (Do These)

| Playbook | Why Now |
|----------|---------|
| **Growth Model** | Unit economics and efficiency modeling |
| **Lead Lifecycle** | Segment-specific lead management |
| **Sales Lifecycle** | Segment-specific sales process |
| **Customer Lifecycle** | Predictive health scoring |
| **GTM Lifecycle** | End-to-end optimization |
| **ABM/ABS Process** | Essential for enterprise segment |
| **Forecasting Model** | Accuracy and predictability |
| **Executive Reporting Suite** | Board and leadership visibility |
| **Customer Success Platform** | CS platform is essential |
| **Quotas and Target Setting** | Segment-specific, data-driven |
| **Renewal Process** | Platform-supported renewals |

### Recommended (If Time/Budget)

| Playbook | Why Consider |
|----------|--------------|
| **CPQ Implementation** | If pricing complexity warrants |
| **Sales Enablement Platform** | If enablement is a bottleneck |
| **Partner Program** | If channel is meaningful |
| **Territory Optimization** | If territories need rebalancing |
| **Multi-Year Contracts** | If multi-year strategy exists |
| **Revenue Intelligence** | If not already implemented |

### Premature (Avoid For Now)

| Playbook | Why Wait |
|----------|----------|
| **Multi-Region Setup** | Typically Platform stage |
| **M&A Integration** | Platform stage |
| **Advanced Governance** | Platform stage |
| **Product-Led Enterprise** | If not already in motion |

## What to Skip at Optimize Stage

These aren't worth the investment yet — organizations at this stage should focus on efficiency and segment optimization, not adding complexity:

- **Multi-region GTM expansion** — geographic expansion adds complexity; optimize current markets first
- **M&A activity** — acquiring before operational excellence risks integration failure
- **Heavy governance structures** — governance should emerge from need, not be imposed prematurely
- **Dramatic org restructuring** — continuous optimization beats periodic upheaval
- **Over-segmentation** — 2-3 clear segments beat 6 fuzzy ones
- **Custom everything** — standardization enables efficiency; customization creates debt
- **New product lines** — unless product-market fit is proven elsewhere, focus on what works
- **Enterprise-only pivot** — if mid-market works, don't abandon it for harder enterprise sales
