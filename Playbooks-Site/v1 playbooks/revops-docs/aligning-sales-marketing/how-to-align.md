# How to Align

## Step 1: Structure

### Reporting Structure
- Both sales and marketing leaders should report to the same individual (not the CEO), such as a Chief Revenue Officer (CRO) or Chief Operating Officer (COO) responsible for all revenue.
- This approach unifies decision-making and prevents departmental disputes over executive approval.

### Decision-Making Authority
- Determine who drives decisions based on your business model:
  - **Sales-led growth motion**: Sales team leads decision-making regarding go-to-market or revenue strategy.
  - **Product-led or high-velocity sales environment**: Marketing team may have more influence due to revenue driven by marketing efforts.

### Operations Team Reporting
- Prevent misalignment by ensuring sales and marketing operations teams report to the same individual (CRO or CMO) to avoid conflicting systems and data reporting.

## Step 2: The Right People

### Interviewing Sales/Marketing Leaders
- Assess if candidates view themselves as part of a unified team by asking about the opposite department's performance at previous companies.
- Look for respectful tone and shared responsibility, not blame-shifting.

## Step 3: Clearly Defined Go-To-Market Processes

### Data Definitions and Processes
- Misalignment frequently stems from differing data definitions and handoff procedures.
- Ensure both teams have mutual understanding of key concepts like "sales qualified lead."
- Define routing and handoff procedures for various lead sources.

## Step 4: Incentive Structure

### Goal Alignment
- Incentives drive behavior, so align them with desired outcomes.
- Common misalignment occurs when marketing's lead generation goal differs from sales' ideal customer profile.
- Consider tying marketing compensation to closed deals or including pipeline generation in sales goals.
- Offer bonuses for driving testimonials or case studies valuable to marketing.

## Step 5: Tools and Technology

### Transparent Goal Tracking
- Implement visible and transparent goal tracking within your CRM (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot).
- Consider more sophisticated BI or pipeline sales management solutions like Looker, Heap, or Funnel Source for complex needs.
- A shared, accurate view of progress fosters collaboration and alignment.

### Routing and Handoff Optimization
- Use tools like LeanData or Chili Piper to optimize routing and handoffs between sales and marketing, ensuring efficient processes.
