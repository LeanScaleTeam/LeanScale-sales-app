## Customer Success Processes

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Organizations at Platform stage operate CS as a scaled, segment-specific function with advanced health scoring, automated interventions, global support, and tight integration with revenue operations. CS is a profit center, not a cost center.

## Onboarding

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Onboarding at Platform stage runs multiple tracks — segment-specific, product-specific, and implementation-complexity-based — with clear SLAs and success metrics.

| Track | Approach | Timeline | Owner |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Enterprise** | White-glove, dedicated PM | 60-120 days | Professional Services |
| **Mid-Market** | Guided, pooled resources | 30-60 days | Implementation team |
| **SMB** | Self-serve + digital assistance | 7-14 days | Digital CS |
| **PLG/Low-touch** | Product-led, automated | Same day - 7 days | Product + Digital CS |

**Onboarding Governance:**

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Kickoff Standards** | Standard agenda, required attendees, recording |
| **Success Criteria** | Defined per segment, product, and use case |
| **Milestone Tracking** | System-tracked, alerts on at-risk |
| **Time-to-Value Metrics** | Tracked and reported by segment |
| **Handoff to CSM** | Formal transition with health baseline |

**Onboarding Content:**

| Asset | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Implementation Guides** | Technical setup documentation |
| **Admin Certification** | Customer admin training and certification |
| **Video Library** | On-demand training content |
| **Office Hours** | Scheduled Q&A sessions |
| **Success Plans** | Template + customization by customer |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **One-size-fits-all onboarding** — segment-specific tracks are non-negotiable
> - **Unclear ownership** — if PS vs CSM ownership is fuzzy, customers suffer
> - **Onboarding without TTV measurement** — if time-to-value isn't tracked, improvement is guesswork

## Success Metrics / Health Scoring

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Health scoring at Platform stage is predictive, multi-factor, and integrated with every customer-facing workflow. Health scores trigger automated and human interventions.

| Health Dimension | Inputs | Weight |
|-----------------|--------|--------|
| **Product Usage** | DAU/MAU, feature adoption, depth of use | 30-40% |
| **Engagement** | Support tickets, meetings, email response | 20-25% |
| **Relationship** | Stakeholder access, champion strength | 15-20% |
| **Business Outcomes** | Reported ROI, stated satisfaction | 15-20% |
| **Financial** | Payment history, expansion history | 10-15% |

**Health Score Tiers:**

| Tier | Score Range | Intervention |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Green** | 80-100 | Expansion focus, advocacy asks |
| **Yellow** | 50-79 | Proactive outreach, risk assessment |
| **Red** | 0-49 | Executive escalation, save motion |

**Predictive Elements:**

| Signal | Prediction |
|--------|-----------|
| **Usage drop >20%** | Churn risk, investigate |
| **Champion job change** | Relationship risk, re-engage |
| **Negative NPS response** | Immediate CSM follow-up |
| **Support ticket volume spike** | Product issues, escalate |
| **No expansion after X months** | Growth opportunity or issue |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Health scores no one trusts** — if CSMs override scores, the model is wrong
> - **Lagging indicators only** — predictive signals matter more than what already happened
> - **Health without action** — a score without triggered workflows is just data

> **Playbook Reference:** See Customer Lifecycle, Customer Success Platform Implementation

## Product Feedback

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Product feedback at Platform stage flows through formal channels — Customer Advisory Board, NPS/CSAT programs, and structured feedback loops that influence roadmap.

| Channel | Frequency | Audience |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Customer Advisory Board** | Quarterly | Top 20-30 customers |
| **NPS Surveys** | Continuous or quarterly | All customers |
| **CSAT (Support)** | Post-ticket | Support interactions |
| **Feature Requests** | Continuous | All customers (via CS or product) |
| **Beta Programs** | Per release | Selected customers |
| **User Research** | Ongoing | Product-driven selection |

**Feedback Governance:**

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **CAB Charter** | Formal membership, commitment, NDA |
| **Request Taxonomy** | Standardized categories for feature requests |
| **Roadmap Communication** | Regular updates on what's planned, what's not |
| **Closed-Loop Feedback** | When features ship, notify requestors |
| **Product Council** | Cross-functional roadmap prioritization |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **CAB as show-and-tell** — if customers don't influence roadmap, they'll stop coming
> - **Feedback black hole** — if customers never hear back, they stop giving feedback
> - **Ignoring silent majority** — NPS from vocal customers isn't representative

> **Playbook Reference:** See NPS and Voice of Customer Launch, Customer Advisory Board Program

## Renewal Process

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Renewals at Platform stage are systematized, multi-track (auto-renewal vs negotiated), and tightly integrated with finance and legal. Renewal is a process, not an event.

| Track | Approach | Timing |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Auto-Renewal** | Contract terms, notice if opting out | 90 days notice |
| **Standard Renewal** | CSM-driven, pricing review | 120 days out |
| **Complex Renewal** | Multi-year, renegotiation | 180+ days out |
| **At-Risk Renewal** | Save motion, executive involvement | 180+ days out |

**Renewal Workflow:**

| Stage | Timing | Owner | Action |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Forecast** | 180 days | Renewal Ops | Identify and segment |
| **Health Check** | 150 days | CSM | Assess risk, escalate if needed |
| **Pricing Review** | 120 days | Deal Desk | Standard vs custom pricing |
| **Proposal** | 90 days | CSM + Renewal Ops | Send renewal terms |
| **Negotiation** | 60-90 days | CSM + Sales (if needed) | Handle objections |
| **Close** | 30 days | Renewal Ops | Execute contract |
| **Post-Renewal** | Day 1 of new term | CSM | Success plan refresh |

**Renewal Metrics:**

| Metric | Target Range |
|--------|-------------|
| **GRR (Gross Revenue Retention)** | 90-95%+ |
| **NRR (Net Revenue Retention)** | 100-120%+ |
| **On-Time Renewal Rate** | 85-95% |
| **Renewal Forecast Accuracy** | 90%+ |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Renewal surprises** — if a renewal is at risk and ops doesn't know 180 days out, process is broken
> - **CSMs negotiating complex deals** — sales or renewal specialists should handle renegotiations
> - **Ignoring auto-renewal terms** — legal and customer expectations must align

> **Playbook Reference:** See Renewal, Churn, NRR, GRR Reporting

## Expansion / Upsell

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Expansion at Platform stage is systematized — playbooks by expansion type, territory rules, and compensation alignment between CS and Sales ensure no friction.

| Expansion Type | Owner | Trigger |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| **Seat/Usage Expansion** | CSM | Usage thresholds, contract terms |
| **Cross-Sell (New Product)** | Sales + CSM | Health + fit signals |
| **Upsell (Higher Tier)** | CSM or Sales | Feature usage, business need |
| **Multi-Year Extension** | Sales | Renewal + expansion combo |

**Expansion Playbooks:**

| Play | Trigger | Motion |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Usage Spike** | Usage >80% of entitlement | CSM outreach, expansion quote |
| **Champion Promoted** | Contact role change | Executive alignment, strategic review |
| **New Team Request** | Support ticket or CSM conversation | Discovery, cross-sell |
| **Product Launch** | New product release | Targeted campaign to fit customers |

**Territory & Comp Alignment:**

| Scenario | Owner | Compensation |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Seat expansion** | CSM | CSM expansion bonus |
| **New product under $X** | CSM | CSM expansion bonus |
| **New product >$X** | Sales (with CSM) | Split or Sales commission |
| **Competitive displacement** | Sales | Full sales credit |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Unclear expansion ownership** — if CS and Sales fight over deals, customers notice
> - **Expansion without health check** — selling more to unhappy customers accelerates churn
> - **Missing signals** — usage data and triggers should be automated, not manual

> **Playbook Reference:** See Expansion and Upsell Playbook

## Reference & Testimonial

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Reference and advocacy at Platform stage is a formal program — advocacy tiers, incentives, and systematic asks that support sales, marketing, and analyst relations.

| Advocacy Type | Value | Ask Frequency |
|--------------|-------|---------------|
| **Reference Call** | High | Per opportunity, limited pool |
| **Case Study** | High | 1x per customer |
| **Video Testimonial** | Very High | 1x per customer |
| **G2/Gartner Review** | High | Quarterly campaigns |
| **Speaking** | Very High | 1-2x per customer per year |
| **Referral** | Very High | Ongoing, incentivized |

**Advocacy Program Tiers:**

| Tier | Benefits | Requirements |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Member** | Community access, swag | Signed agreement |
| **Advocate** | Early access, recognition | 1+ advocacy activity |
| **Champion** | Executive access, exclusive events | 3+ activities, NPS promoter |
| **VIP** | Advisory board, roadmap influence | Top advocates, strategic accounts |

**Advocacy Operations:**

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Advocacy Platform** | Influitive, Gainsight Advocate, or similar |
| **Ask Management** | Limit asks per customer, track fatigue |
| **Incentives** | Points, rewards, recognition (not cash) |
| **Sales Reference Matching** | Industry, use case, segment matching |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Over-asking references** — reference fatigue is real; protect top advocates
> - **Advocacy without reciprocity** — if customers give and never receive, they stop
> - **Ignoring reference quality** — bad references hurt more than no references

> **Playbook Reference:** See Customer Reference and Testimonial Program

## Support

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Support at Platform stage is global, tiered, SLA-driven, and integrated with CS — support is both reactive (ticket resolution) and proactive (health signal source).

| Tier | Scope | SLA |
|------|-------|-----|
| **L1 (Tier 1)** | Known issues, how-to, basic troubleshooting | 4-8 hours |
| **L2 (Tier 2)** | Complex issues, configuration, workarounds | 8-24 hours |
| **L3 (Tier 3)** | Engineering escalation, bugs, custom work | 24-72 hours |
| **Premium Support** | Dedicated support, faster SLAs, named contacts | Per contract |

**Global Support Model:**

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Follow-the-Sun** | Coverage in AMER, EMEA, APAC |
| **Language Support** | Key languages based on customer distribution |
| **Escalation Path** | Clear escalation to L2/L3/Engineering |
| **CS Integration** | Support tickets feed health scoring |
| **Self-Service** | Knowledge base, community, chatbot |

**Support Metrics:**

| Metric | Target Range |
|--------|-------------|
| **First Response Time** | Under 4 hours (business hours) |
| **Resolution Time** | Under 24 hours for L1, under 72 for L2 |
| **CSAT** | 90%+ |
| **Ticket Volume per Customer** | Tracked, trend analysis |
| **Self-Service Deflection** | 30-50% |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Support as silo** — if support data doesn't inform CS and product, insights are lost
> - **Ignoring self-service** — at scale, not everything can be human-handled
> - **One SLA for all** — enterprise customers expect and pay for faster response

> **Playbook Reference:** See Support System Implementation

## CS Platform

**Stage-appropriate approach:** The CS platform at Platform stage is the system of record for customer health, workflows, and outcomes — fully integrated with CRM, product, and support.

| Capability | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Health Scoring** | Multi-factor, predictive, automated |
| **Playbook Automation** | Triggered actions based on health, lifecycle |
| **360° Customer View** | CRM, product, support data unified |
| **Renewal Management** | Forecasting, workflows, alerts |
| **Expansion Identification** | Signals, qualification, handoff |
| **Reporting & Analytics** | GRR, NRR, health trends, CSM performance |

**Platform Integrations:**

| System | Data Flow |
|--------|----------|
| **CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot)** | Account, opportunity, contact sync |
| **Product Analytics** | Usage data, feature adoption |
| **Support (Zendesk, Intercom)** | Ticket data, CSAT |
| **BI (Looker, Tableau)** | Reporting, dashboards |
| **Communication (Email, Slack)** | Outreach logging, alerts |

**Platform Governance:**

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Admin Ownership** | Dedicated CS Ops admin |
| **Data Quality** | Regular audits, deduplication |
| **Playbook Governance** | Approval process for new playbooks |
| **Performance Tracking** | CSM productivity, playbook effectiveness |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **CS platform as CRM duplicate** — the platform should add value, not replicate
> - **Over-automation** — not everything should be automated; judgment matters
> - **Ignoring adoption** — if CSMs don't use the platform, it's expensive shelfware
