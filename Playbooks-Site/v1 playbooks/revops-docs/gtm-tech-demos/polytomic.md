## Overview

This page features an interview and product demonstration with Ghalib Suleiman, co-founder and CEO of Polytomic, a unified ETL and reverse ETL platform designed specifically for RevOps and data teams.

## Key Topics Discussed

### Founder's Journey

Suleiman brings 10+ years of experience leading data teams supporting RevOps functions. He recognized a critical pain point: data remained siloed across organizational departments (engineering, product, marketing, finance), creating friction and delaying revenue-impacting decisions.

### Core Problem Statement

Organizations struggle with data fragmentation. RevOps teams need access to product usage data, billing information, and customer activity metrics—typically locked behind engineering departments—to enable effective churn prevention and upsell strategies.

### Solution: Polytomic Platform

The platform enables non-technical RevOps professionals to move data between systems without engineering involvement. Key capabilities include:

- **Data Models**: Authorization layer defining which fields sync across systems
- **Identity Mapping**: Linking unique identifiers (email, user ID) between source and destination systems
- **Sync Configuration**: Create, update, or delete modes with customizable scheduling
- **Filtering and Overrides**: Point-and-click rules for data transformation
- **SQL Flexibility**: Custom query support for complex data scenarios
- **Monitoring**: Audit trails, error notifications via email/Slack

### Demonstrated Use Cases

- Moving product usage data into Salesforce (typically a multi-week engineering project, achieved in 5 minutes)
- Syncing billing/consumption data for accurate revenue recognition
- Enabling CS teams to identify churn risks and upsell opportunities through customer 360 views

### Strategic Impact

Connecting product data to CRM systems enables revenue-focused initiatives: retention, expansion revenue, accurate billing, and reduced manual reconciliation efforts.

### Cross-Functional Collaboration Insights

Suleiman emphasizes breaking organizational silos through empathy and humble communication. Success requires both RevOps teams to educate engineering on business impact and technical teams to recognize that small time investments create significant downstream value.
