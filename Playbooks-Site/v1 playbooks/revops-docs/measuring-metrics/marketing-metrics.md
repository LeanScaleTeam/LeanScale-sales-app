# Marketing Metrics

This guide covers six essential marketing performance metrics that startup teams should track to drive growth and optimize their go-to-market strategy.

## 1. Pipeline Creation and Distribution

Marketing teams should measure the volume of qualified leads generated across different channels and sources.

By segmenting pipeline creation by:
- Channel
- Lead source
- Sales representative

Teams can identify uneven opportunity distribution and adjust resource allocation accordingly.

## 2. MQL to SQL Conversion Rate and Cycle

This metric tracks the efficiency of converting Marketing Qualified Leads into Sales Qualified Leads.

Understanding both aspects provides insight into:
- **Conversion percentage**: Campaign effectiveness
- **Time required**: Nurturing process efficiency

## 3. Channel Efficiency

Not all marketing channels deliver equal results. This metric evaluates the relationship between:
- SQLs generated
- MQLs required
- Budget invested per channel

It helps teams focus resources on the highest-impact channels and optimize spending decisions.

## 4. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) to Lifetime Value (LTV) Ratio

This compares customer acquisition expenses against expected lifetime revenue.

**Key insight**: It is important to strike a balance between CAC and LTV to ensure sustainable business growth.

Marketing teams can influence this ratio through:
- Improved campaign efficiency
- Targeting high-value customers

## 5. Lead Impact Matrix

This analytical tool combines:
- Conversion rates
- Overall lead generation impact

Use it to identify the most efficient and effective channels, enabling teams to optimize their channel mix and maximize return on investment.

## 6. Number of Campaigns to Generate an SQL

This metric reveals how many marketing touchpoints are typically required to convert a prospect into an SQL.

It reflects:
- The complexity of the buyer's journey
- The campaign diversity needed for effective engagement
