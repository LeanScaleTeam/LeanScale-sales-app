# Lead Lifecycle

Lead lifecycle stages track potential customers through a sales funnel and help identify where leads stand in the buying process.

## Key Lead Lifecycle Stages

The lead lifecycle consists of five primary stages:

### 1. Marketing Lead
Any contact in the system, regardless of engagement level.

### 2. Marketing Engaged Lead
Prospects who've interacted with content (downloaded papers, watched videos, etc.).

### 3. Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL)
High-interest leads ready for sales engagement.

### 4. Sales Accepted Lead (SAL)
Leads formally acknowledged by salespeople who've begun outreach.

### 5. Sales Qualified Lead (SQL)
**The most critical phase** where sales has conducted initial meetings and opened opportunities.

## Entry Criteria Approaches

Two primary methods qualify leads:

### Action-based
Triggered by specific activities like:
- Whitepaper downloads
- Webinar registration
- Demo requests
- Contact form submissions

### Scoring Model
Evaluates multiple factors including:
- Website activity
- Content engagement
- Firmographic data
- Behavioral signals

## Detailed Stage Reference

| Stage | Definition |
|-------|-----------|
| **Anonymous Visitor** | Website visitors without identifying information |
| **Lead** | Database entries excluding non-prospects |
| **MQL** | Handoff point using ICP fit and intent-level qualification |
| **SAL** | Received MQL without immediate disqualification |
| **SQL** | Discovery call/demo scheduled between prospect and rep |

Understanding these stages enables more effective sales-marketing strategy development and alignment.
