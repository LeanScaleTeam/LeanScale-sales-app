# Post-Fundraise Playbook

This guide outlines critical steps and obstacles that emerge immediately following a successful fundraising round for startups.

## 1. Due Diligence Findings Report

Following fundraising completion, investors conduct thorough due diligence to validate information presented in proposals and assess company financials, sales metrics, marketing performance, and technology infrastructure. The resulting report identifies improvement opportunities, challenges, and strategic recommendations aligned with mutual investor-company objectives.

## 2. Financial Model

Companies must develop a financial model that aligns with growth projections shared during fundraising, determining capital allocation strategies, growth initiatives, and required investments to achieve stated goals.

## 3. Go-to-Market (GTM) Operating Plan

A comprehensive GTM plan synchronized with the financial model should include:

- **Growth Target Alignment**: Define bookings goals, expansion targets, and churn management objectives based on strategic priorities
- **Demand Generation Plan**: Establish required lead volumes (MQLs, SQLs, etc.) and identify highest-efficiency marketing channels for capital allocation
- **Sales Capacity Plan**: Confirm sufficient sales resources for lead conversion, including hiring requirements, quotas, and activity benchmarks
- **Customer Success Plan**: Outline personnel and technology infrastructure needed for customer success delivery

## 4. Hiring and Recruitment

Develop comprehensive hiring strategies addressing recruitment, onboarding, training, and retention challenges, including talent sourcing approaches and performance management protocols.

## 5. Post-Fundraising Challenges

### Aligning Targets and Assumptions

Plans contain assumptions requiring regular testing and iterative adjustments.

### Interconnectedness

Marketing, sales, customer success, and hiring initiatives must maintain alignment to prevent cascading failures.

### Hiring Speed

Begin recruitment immediately given typical transition timelines.

### Planning and Decision Velocity

Accelerate planning and decision-making to prevent execution delays.

## 6. Conclusion

Effective planning and execution capabilities demonstrate investor appeal and increase successful exit likelihood. Conversely, weak execution capabilities may trigger down rounds or fire sales.
