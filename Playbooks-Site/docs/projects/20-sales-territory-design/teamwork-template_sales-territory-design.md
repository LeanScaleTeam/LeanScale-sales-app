### Task List: (Sales Territory Design) 1. Assessment & Data Preparation
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Audit Current Territory Structure and Performance | 3h | Analyze existing territory assignments, coverage patterns, and performance data to identify imbalances and gaps. End state: Gap analysis document showing territory performance disparities and coverage issues.<br /><br />• Pull territory performance reports from CRM for last 4 quarters (revenue, pipeline, win rate by territory)<br />• Identify quota attainment variance across territories (flag if >20% variance between top and bottom performers)<br />• Map current account distribution per rep (count of accounts, total ACV potential)<br />• Document existing territory assignment logic (geographic, industry, named accounts, or hybrid)<br />• Interview 2-3 sales managers on perceived territory imbalances and rep complaints<br />• Quantify coverage gaps (accounts with no owner, white space in target market) |
| 2. Define Segmentation Criteria and Territory Model | 2.5h | Determine the criteria for territory segmentation based on company strategy, market structure, and sales motion. End state: Documented segmentation framework approved by sales leadership.<br /><br />• Review company growth objectives (new markets, verticals, customer segments)<br />• Evaluate territory model options: geographic, industry-based, named account, or hybrid<br />• For B2B SaaS: recommend hybrid model (enterprise by industry, SMB by geography)<br />• Define primary and secondary segmentation criteria (e.g., geography + company size)<br />• Document account assignment rules (what determines which rep owns an account)<br />• Get sign-off from VP Sales on segmentation approach before proceeding |
| 3. Collect and Clean Account Data | 2.5h | Gather comprehensive data on target accounts, market potential, and competitive landscape to inform territory design. End state: Clean, deduplicated account list with key attributes populated.<br /><br />• Export full account list from CRM with key fields (industry, size, location, owner, revenue)<br />• Identify and merge duplicate accounts to prevent double-counting<br />• Build account hierarchy (link subsidiaries to parent companies) to avoid territory disputes<br />• Enrich missing data using ZoomInfo, Apollo, or similar tools (employee count, revenue, industry)<br />• Flag accounts missing critical segmentation data for manual review<br />• Validate data quality with sales managers (spot-check 20-30 accounts) |
| 4. Score and Prioritize Accounts | 2.5h | Build a scoring model to prioritize accounts by revenue potential and fit. End state: All target accounts scored and ranked with clear tier assignments.<br /><br />• Define scoring criteria: deal size potential, ICP fit, buying signals, competitive presence<br />• Build simple 1-5 scoring model (or leverage existing lead scoring if available)<br />• Apply scores to full account list programmatically<br />• Segment accounts into tiers (A/B/C or Enterprise/Mid-Market/SMB)<br />• Validate scoring output with sales leadership (top 50 accounts should feel right)<br />• Document scoring methodology for future territory reviews |

### Task List: (Sales Territory Design) 2. Territory Design & Rollout
**Contains:** Parts 3-4

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 5. Calculate Territory Capacity and Workload | 2h | Determine how many accounts each rep can effectively manage based on sales motion and deal complexity. End state: Defined capacity targets per rep role (e.g., 50 accounts for enterprise AE, 200 for SMB).<br /><br />• Analyze historical data: average accounts per rep, deals closed per quarter, time per deal<br />• Factor in sales cycle length and deal complexity by segment<br />• Define target account load per rep role (enterprise AE vs. SMB AE vs. SDR)<br />• Calculate total capacity needed vs. current headcount<br />• Identify if territory design requires headcount changes (flag for leadership) |
| 6. Create Balanced Territory Assignments | 3.5h | Design territories that provide equal opportunity for sales reps while maximizing market coverage. End state: Draft territory map with accounts assigned to reps and balanced workload distribution.<br /><br />• Group accounts by segmentation criteria (geography, industry, tier)<br />• Use territory mapping tool (Salesforce Maps, Fullcast, Anaplan) or spreadsheet model<br />• Assign accounts to reps balancing: total ACV potential, account count, geographic proximity<br />• Target &lt;15% variance in territory potential between reps at same level<br />• Create visual territory map showing coverage and rep assignments<br />• Document rationale for assignment decisions (for stakeholder review) |
| 7. Define Rules of Engagement | 2.5h | Document clear ownership rules for edge cases and account transitions. End state: ROE document covering account ownership, lead routing, and conflict resolution.<br /><br />• Define account ownership triggers (what moves an account to a new rep)<br />• Document lead routing rules for inbound in each territory<br />• Address national accounts with local presence (who owns what)<br />• Define handoff process when accounts change territories<br />• Create conflict resolution process (who decides disputed accounts)<br />• Get legal/compliance review if territories cross international boundaries |
| 8. Validate with Sales Leadership | 2h | Review proposed territories with sales leadership and incorporate feedback before implementation. End state: Final territory assignments approved by VP Sales and sales managers.<br /><br />• Present territory proposal to sales leadership (VP Sales, regional managers)<br />• Share territory maps, account assignments, and balance metrics<br />• Collect feedback on specific account assignments and potential issues<br />• Adjust territories based on rep knowledge (account relationships, historical context)<br />• Document approved changes and final assignments<br />• Get formal sign-off before CRM implementation |
| 9. Implement Territory Assignments in CRM | 3.5h | Configure territory assignments in the CRM system with proper account ownership and visibility rules. End state: CRM updated with new territory assignments, owners, and reporting structure.<br /><br />• Back up current territory/ownership data before making changes<br />• Update account owner fields in Salesforce/HubSpot for reassigned accounts<br />• Configure territory management features (Salesforce Territory Management 2.0 or equivalent)<br />• Set up territory-based sharing rules for visibility requirements<br />• Update lead assignment rules to route to correct territory owners<br />• Build territory performance reports and dashboards<br />• Test with 5-10 sample accounts to verify assignments and routing |
| 10. Communicate Changes and Train Sales Team | 2.5h | Roll out new territory assignments to the sales team with clear documentation and training. End state: Sales team understands new territories, account assignments, and rules of engagement.<br /><br />• Prepare territory change communication (email, deck, or video)<br />• Explain rationale for changes (data-driven, growth-focused, balanced opportunity)<br />• Provide each rep with their account list and territory boundaries<br />• Walk through ROE document and conflict resolution process<br />• Host Q&A session to address concerns and questions<br />• Distribute quick-reference guide for territory rules |
| 11. Establish Monitoring and Review Cadence | 3h | Set up tracking to monitor territory performance and schedule regular reviews. End state: Reporting in place and quarterly review cadence established.<br /><br />• Build territory performance dashboard (revenue, pipeline, quota attainment by territory)<br />• Define key metrics to track: revenue per territory, pipeline coverage (3-4x quota), win rates<br />• Schedule quarterly territory reviews with sales leadership<br />• Document trigger points for ad-hoc review (market shifts, rep attrition, M&A)<br />• Create process for territory adjustments between major reviews<br />• Hand off monitoring and adjustment process to sales ops owner |
