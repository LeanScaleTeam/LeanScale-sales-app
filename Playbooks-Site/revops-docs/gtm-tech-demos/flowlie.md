## Overview

This page features a comprehensive demo and interview transcript with Vlad Cazacu, founder and CEO of Flowlie, discussing a fundraising operations platform designed to help founders navigate investor connections and capital raising processes.

## Key Topics Discussed

### Introduction and Founder Background

Vlad shares his entrepreneurial journey from Bucharest, Romania, including an early textbook trading venture in college and subsequent roles in venture capital across New York, Austin, and Miami. His experience informed the creation of Flowlie as a solution addressing founder challenges in fundraising.

### Platform Overview

Flowlie operates as a "fundraising operation system" rather than a marketplace. The platform includes:

- **Investor Research**: Feed scoring algorithms (version 5) that predict investor fit based on thesis, industries, business models, and check sizes
- **Network Analysis**: Maps connections within founder networks to surface introduction paths with predicted success metrics
- **Investor CRM**: Tracks sources, commitments, pass reasons, and relationship history
- **Meeting Management**: Calendar integration with transcript analysis and AI-generated task management
- **AI Agent**: Performs actions like investor research, target list creation, and introduction discovery through chat interface

### Key Features Demonstrated

**Introduction Path Discovery**: The platform surfaces introduction routes by analyzing team and founder network connections, providing "worm intro" paths ranked by impact score.

**Meeting Tracking Workflow**: Integrates calendar data, transcript analysis, sentiment detection, and automated task generation from investor calls.

**Proprietary Advantages**: Unlike generic CRMs, Flowlie maintains high-quality data on actively deploying investors rather than comprehensive but less accurate databases.

### Strategic Fundraising Advice

Vlad emphasizes an "80% preparation, 20% execution" approach, highlighting:

- Building extensive target lists (100-150 funds rather than 10-20)
- Maximizing warm introduction paths before cold outreach
- Creating calendar density through forward-loaded introduction requests
- Consistent follow-up based on investor feedback
