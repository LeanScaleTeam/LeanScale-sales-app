End state: Data quality report with remediation plan for critical fields, cleaned records ready for nurture.<br /><br />• Audit key fields required for personalization (first name, company, industry, title)<br />• Identify records with missing or invalid data that would break personalization<br />• Flag duplicate records that could cause leads to receive multiple nurture streams<br />• Create data cleanup tasks for client or execute bulk updates as appropriate<br />• Verify lead scoring is functioning and thresholds are appropriate for nurture triggers<br />• Document any data quality issues that may impact program effectiveness |
| 6. Configure Exclusion Lists and Suppression Logic | 2h | Set up exclusion rules to prevent over-communication and ensure compliance with suppression requirements. End state: Exclusion lists and suppression logic configured to prevent nurture conflicts.<br /><br />• Create exclusion list for leads currently in sales active follow-up<br />• Create exclusion list for leads in other active nurture programs (prevent overlap)<br />• Set up suppression for unsubscribed, bounced, and compliance-flagged contacts<br />• Configure frequency caps to prevent email fatigue (e.g., max 1 nurture email per week)<br />• Document exclusion logic and review with stakeholders<br />• Test exclusion logic with sample records before launch |
