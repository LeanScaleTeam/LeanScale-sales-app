**Step-by-Step Instructions **

Go to the **Opportunity Fields **page.

Click the **New **button.

Select the **Text **field type.

Enter a name for the field, such as "Manager Notes".

Select the **Long Text Area **input type.

Check the **Keep 3 Visible Lines **checkbox.

In the **Field-Level Security **section, select the **Visible **checkbox for the manager profile.

Also, select the **Visible **checkbox for the System Administrator profile.

Add the field to the opportunity layout.

Once you have created the field, you can add it to the opportunity layout so that managers can see it. To do this, go to the **Opportunity Layouts **page and edit the layout that you want to add the field to. Drag and drop the field into the desired location on the layout.

Managers will now be able to see the field on the opportunity record page. They can add notes to the field, but other users will not be able to see them.
