## Graduation Readiness

These are the signs that it's time to graduate from Stabilize stage:

- [ ] Sales motion works with non-founder sellers (at least one rep hitting quota)
- [ ] Pipeline is predictable (forecasting with reasonable accuracy)
- [ ] Basic processes are documented and followed
- [ ] First hires are ramped and productive
- [ ] Revenue approaching $5M ARR
- [ ] Ready to build a team, not just add individuals

## What Breaks If Too Early

- Hire a sales manager for a motion that only works with founders
- Build elaborate territory models before forecasting is reliable
- Invest in ABM before ICP is proven
- Buy enterprise tools before there's capacity to maintain them

## What Breaks If Too Late

- Founder becomes bottleneck — can't be in every deal
- Opportunity cost — could be growing faster with more capacity
- Competition catches up while staying small
- Burnout — founder can't sustain the pace
