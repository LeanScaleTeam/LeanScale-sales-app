# The GTM OS

A stage-based operating system for B2B SaaS/AI companies with PLG and SLG growth motions.

Built by founders, operators, and the team building these systems every day — LeanScale.

---

## Why This Exists

Companies waste enormous energy doing things appropriate for later stages. A $500K ARR startup implementing enterprise territory design. A Series A company building complex attribution models. A founder spending weeks on CPQ configuration when they have 10 customers.

The pattern is predictable: teams copy what worked at bigger companies, consultants recommend "best practices" designed for different contexts, and founders conflate activity with progress.

The GTM OS provides a different approach. For each stage of growth, it specifies what to focus on, what to defer, and what to actively avoid. The goal is stage-appropriate execution — doing what matters now, not what looks impressive.

## The Five Stages

| Stage         | ARR        | Headcount | Primary Focus                     | What Breaks at This Stage          |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Build**     | $0–$1M     | 1–10      | Proving the business works        | Founder-led everything, finding PMF |
| **Stabilize** | $1–$5M     | 10–30     | Making growth repeatable          | First hires, tribal knowledge       |
| **Scale**     | $5–$15M    | 30–80     | Adding capacity without chaos     | Process debt, tool sprawl           |
| **Optimize**  | $15–$40M   | 80–200    | Improving efficiency and leverage | Margin erosion, complexity bloat    |
| **Platform**  | $40M+      | 200+      | Running a durable company         | Org drag, governance overhead       |

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Find your stage** based on ARR range
2. **Read the relevant sections** — each stage covers 12 dimensions of GTM
3. **Note the classifications** — Essential (do now), Recommended (consider), Premature (skip)
4. **Reference the playbooks** — detailed implementation guides for each process

The most valuable insight often isn't what to do — it's what to skip. Each stage explicitly identifies processes, tools, and metrics that are premature. Skipping them isn't cutting corners; it's maintaining focus.

## What Each Stage Covers

Every stage addresses 12 dimensions:

1. **Overview** — Context, challenges, what success looks like
2. **GTM Team Structure** — Who you need (humans and AI agents)
3. **Sales Processes** — What to build, what to skip
4. **Marketing Processes** — What to build, what to skip
5. **Customer Success Processes** — What to build, what to skip
6. **Partnerships** — When it makes sense, when it doesn't
7. **Tech Stack** — Stage-appropriate tools with specific recommendations
8. **Metrics** — What to measure now, what doesn't matter yet
9. **AI Agents** — Automated and interactive agents for this stage
10. **Risks and Challenges** — What kills companies at this stage
11. **When to Graduate** — Signs you're ready for the next stage
12. **Playbook Mapping** — Which LeanScale playbooks are Essential / Recommended / Premature

## What Makes This Different

**AI agents as team members.** Most GTM frameworks assume human-only teams. The GTM OS treats AI agents as first-class team members — specifying which automated agents handle recurring tasks and which interactive agents collaborate on judgment-heavy work. The "first hire" calculation changes when AI agents are filling gaps.

**Stage-appropriate everything.** Tools, metrics, processes, and team structures are all specified per stage. A CRM recommendation at Build is different from Scale. A metric that matters at Optimize is noise at Stabilize.

**What NOT to do.** Each stage includes explicit guidance on what to skip. This is often more valuable than knowing what to do — avoiding premature complexity preserves the focus that early-stage companies need.
