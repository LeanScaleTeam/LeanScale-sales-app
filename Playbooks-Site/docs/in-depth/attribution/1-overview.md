# Attribution Overview

Lead & Opportunity Attribution - Technical & Strategic Attribution Implementation

## 1. Project Overview

### What is Lead & Opportunity Attribution?

**Definition:** A technical and strategic project that implements a multi-touch attribution model to track and assign credit to marketing and sales activities that contribute to lead generation and opportunity creation. The project connects CRM, marketing automation, and web analytics data to provide visibility into which campaigns, channels, and touchpoints drive pipeline and revenue.

**What it is NOT:** Not a marketing automation platform implementation (that's a prerequisite). Not a lead lifecycle/stage definition project (separate project). Not a reporting dashboard build (attribution provides the data model; reporting is a downstream deliverable). Not a budget allocation exercise (attribution is backward-looking and informs but does not prescribe spend).

### What Attribution Unlocks

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Marketing can't prove ROI | Clear pipeline contribution by campaign/channel |
| Vanity metrics only (clicks, impressions) | Revenue attribution to touchpoints |
| Siloed data across systems | Unified view of buyer journey |
| Sales/marketing finger-pointing | Shared understanding of lead quality |
| Gut-feel budget decisions | Data-informed channel investment |

**What you get:**
- A unified attribution model that assigns credit to touchpoints across the buyer journey
- Clear visibility into which activities drive MQLs, opportunities, and closed-won revenue
- Data foundation for optimizing marketing spend toward highest-performing channels
- Shared language between sales and marketing about what's working

### ICP Value Proposition

**Pain it solves:** Marketing cannot prove ROI on campaigns because touchpoint data is siloed across CRM, marketing automation, and web analytics. Leadership asks "which campaigns are working?" and marketing can only point to vanity metrics (clicks, impressions) rather than pipeline contribution. Sales and marketing finger-point about lead quality because there's no shared view of the buyer journey.

**Outcome delivered:** A unified attribution model that assigns credit to touchpoints across the buyer journey, enabling marketing to report on pipeline contribution by campaign/channel/source. Clear visibility into which activities drive MQLs, opportunities, and closed-won revenue. Data foundation for optimizing marketing spend toward highest-performing channels.

### The Attribution Model Spectrum

Understanding the trade-offs between attribution model complexity:

| Model | Description | Best For | Limitation |
|-------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **First-Touch** | 100% credit to first interaction | Understanding top-of-funnel | Ignores nurture touchpoints |
| **Last-Touch** | 100% credit to final interaction | Short sales cycles | Ignores awareness activities |
| **Linear** | Equal credit across all touches | Simple multi-touch | Doesn't weight by importance |
| **U-Shaped** | 40/40/20 to first, lead creation, middle | B2B lead gen | Requires clear conversion points |
| **W-Shaped** | 30/30/30/10 to first, lead, opp, close | Complex B2B sales | More setup required |
| **Time-Decay** | More credit to recent touches | Long sales cycles | May undervalue awareness |

**Recommendation for B2B:** Start with U-shaped or W-shaped. Single-touch models (first or last) miss 90%+ of influencing activities in complex B2B buying.

### The Data Behind the Problem

Multi-touch attribution is critical because B2B buying has changed:

- **Average B2B deal involves 6-10 decision makers** — each consuming content and engaging with different channels
- **Buyers are 57-70% through their journey** before engaging with sales
- **70% of the buyer journey happens through digital self-service** — content, webinars, website visits
- **Average B2B sales cycle is 4-6 months** — many touchpoints over extended period

**The cost of getting it wrong:**
- Marketing budgets misallocated to channels that don't drive pipeline
- High-performing campaigns get cut because they're invisible in last-touch reporting
- Sales blames marketing for "bad leads" when the issue is attribution visibility
- Board asks "what's our CAC by channel?" and marketing can't answer

### Pain Points This Project Solves

| Pain Point | What Attribution Enables |
|------------|-------------------------|
| "Which campaigns are working?" gets vague answers | Pipeline contribution by campaign, channel, source |
| Marketing reports clicks/impressions, not revenue | Revenue attribution to touchpoints |
| Siloed data across CRM, MA, analytics | Connected view of full buyer journey |
| Can't justify marketing budget requests | Data-backed investment recommendations |
| Sales/marketing disagree on lead quality | Shared visibility into what influences deals |
| No idea which content drives pipeline | Content attribution by opportunity influence |
