## Tech Stack

**Principle:** Optimize the existing stack. Consolidation opportunities. Integration maturity. This is about getting more from current investments, not adding tools.

## Stack Evolution at Optimize

| Category | Scale Stage | Optimize Stage | Focus |
|----------|------------|----------------|-------|
| **CRM** | Professional | Enterprise features, advanced reporting | Utilization, not upgrade |
| **MAP** | Professional | Enterprise, full feature use | Automation depth |
| **Sales Engagement** | Active | Advanced features, analytics | Rep efficiency |
| **CS Platform** | Implementing | Mature, predictive | ROI realization |
| **BI/Analytics** | Building | Mature, self-serve | Insight democratization |
| **ABM** | Implementing | Scaled, multi-channel | Program ROI |
| **Revenue Intelligence** | Active | Advanced, forecasting | Accuracy improvement |

## Tech Stack Optimization Areas

| Area | Optimization Approach |
|------|---------------------|
| **Consolidation** | Reduce overlapping tools |
| **Utilization** | Increase feature adoption of existing tools |
| **Integration** | Improve data flow between systems |
| **Automation** | Automate manual processes |
| **Governance** | Standardize usage, reduce customization debt |

## Typical Optimize Stage Stack

| Category | Tools | Investment Level |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| **CRM** | Salesforce Enterprise, HubSpot Enterprise | High — fully utilized |
| **MAP** | Marketo, HubSpot Marketing Enterprise, Pardot | High — advanced automation |
| **Sales Engagement** | Outreach, Salesloft, Groove | High — team-wide adoption |
| **CS Platform** | Gainsight, Totango, ChurnZero | High — essential |
| **ABM** | 6sense, Demandbase, Terminus | Medium-High — if enterprise focus |
| **Revenue Intelligence** | Gong, Chorus, Clari | High — forecasting + coaching |
| **BI** | Looker, Tableau, Mode | High — self-serve analytics |
| **Data Enrichment** | ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Clay | High — quality data |
| **CPQ** | Salesforce CPQ, DealHub, PandaDoc | Medium — if complexity warrants |

## Tech Stack Efficiency Metrics

| Metric | What It Tells |
|--------|---------------|
| **Feature utilization** | Are tools being used? |
| **Cost per user** | Efficiency of spend |
| **Integration health** | Data flowing correctly |
| **Admin time** | Maintenance burden |
| **User satisfaction** | Team adoption |

**What NOT to do:**
- **Adding tools without consolidation** — more tools ≠ better outcomes
- **Ignoring utilization** — paying for unused features
- **Customization debt** — too much customization creates maintenance burden
- **Siloed decisions** — tech decisions should be cross-functional
