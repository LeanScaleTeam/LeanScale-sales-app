| 6. Build Customer Health Score Formula | 3.5h | Configure the health score calculation combining multiple signals into a single risk indicator. End state: Working health score formula that categorizes accounts as healthy, at-risk, or critical.<br /><br />• Define health score scale (0-100 or Red/Yellow/Green categories)<br />• Weight each signal based on historical churn correlation analysis<br />• Configure product usage signals (login frequency, feature adoption, active users)<br />• Add support health signals (ticket volume, escalations, unresolved issues)<br />• Include engagement signals (meeting attendance, email responsiveness, executive sponsor status)<br />• Add NPS/CSAT scores if available<br />• Build the formula in CRM (Salesforce formula field, HubSpot calculated property, or external tool)<br />• Test health scores against known churned accounts to validate accuracy |
| 7. Create Automated Renewal Alert Workflows | 3.5h | Build the 90/60/30-day alert automation that triggers CSM tasks and notifications. End state: Working automation that fires alerts at correct intervals and assigns tasks to renewal owners.<br /><br />• Build 90-day renewal alert workflow (initial outreach trigger)<br />• Build 60-day renewal alert workflow (follow-up/escalation trigger)<br />• Build 30-day renewal alert workflow (urgent action trigger)<br />• Configure task creation with specific instructions for each stage<br />• Set up Slack/email notifications to CSM and manager for at-risk accounts<br />• Add escalation automation for accounts with declining health + upcoming renewal<br />• Test each workflow with sample accounts to verify correct timing and assignment |
| 8. Build Renewal Pipeline Dashboard | 3.5h | Create the reporting dashboard showing renewal pipeline, risk distribution, and CSM workload. End state: Live dashboard providing at-a-glance renewal visibility for CS leadership.<br /><br />• Build renewal pipeline view showing total renewal value by month (next 3-6 months)<br />• Add health status breakdown (healthy/at-risk/critical) with dollar values<br />• Create CSM workload view showing renewals by owner with health distribution<br />• Add trend charts showing health score changes over time<br />• Include churn risk summary highlighting accounts needing immediate attention<br />• Configure dashboard permissions and sharing for CS team access<br />• Set up scheduled dashboard email to leadership (weekly renewal summary) |
