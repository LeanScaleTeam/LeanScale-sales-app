## Page Overview

This is a GTM Tech Demo interview featuring Prakash Reina, founder and CEO of Subskribe, discussing their unified quote-to-cash platform.

## Key Topics Discussed

### Platform Overview

Subskribe positions itself as a unified code-to-revenue platform that consolidates CPQ, billing, accounts receivable, and revenue recognition into a single system. As Prakash explains, the platform sits between CRM and ERP systems, eliminating the need for multiple disconnected tools.

### Founding Story

Prakash founded Subskribe after experiencing pain points at Okta, where rapid growth (scaling from under $100M to $1B in five years) exposed critical gaps in traditional quote-to-cash processes. He observed that "SEC/compliance rules are uniform across public SAS companies" yet inefficiencies persist unnecessarily across implementations.

## Core Features

### AI-Powered Deal Assistant

The Slack-based "deal" assistant converts natural language requests into executable quotes. Reps can type requirements, and the AI intelligently applies business rules, product logic, and compliance requirements without manual intervention.

### Guided Selling

Rather than traditional CPQ interfaces, Subskribe uses business-context questions to route users through decision trees, automatically mapping selections to correct products, pricing, and terms.

### Usage-Based Billing

The platform supports multiple consumption models: pure pay-as-you-go, prepaid-plus-overage, and credit pool structures—essential for AI and modern SaaS offerings.

### Advanced Analytics

Looker-powered command centers provide visibility into deal pipelines, ARR momentum, usage patterns, and aging reports. Reports distinguish between new logos, upsells, renewals, and add-ons with standardized metrics.

## Operational Impact

The platform addresses operational bottlenecks. Prakash notes that many large companies avoid profitable deals because cancel-and-restructure operations require extensive cross-functional coordination. Subskribe enables reps to execute complex amendments independently.

### Multi-Entity Support

The system handles acquisition scenarios, multi-currency transactions, tax engine integrations, and payment gateway connections through a unified data model.

## Main Content Highlights

### On Standardization

Rather than treating quote-to-cash as a competitive advantage, Subskribe advocates for industry standardization, arguing that most SaaS companies face identical compliance requirements.

### On Adoption

The platform prioritizes ease of use for sales representatives rather than deal teams, reducing training time and enabling faster quote generation without sacrificing policy compliance.

### Integration Strategy

Real-time synchronization with Salesforce and HubSpot pushes granular data (entry/exit ARR, TCV, line-level details, ARR trends) back to CRM systems for unified reporting.

### Post-Close Process

Once a deal closes, the same order object generates invoices, eliminating manual reconciliation and ensuring financial data matches sales records.

## Notable Quotes

"No salesperson wants to use a CPQ." - Prakash highlights why the AI assistant and guided selling approach matters.

"This is going to bring 100,000 more but...five people have to spend two days" - Example of operational costs preventing revenue-positive deals.
