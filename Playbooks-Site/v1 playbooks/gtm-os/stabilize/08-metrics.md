## Metrics to Measure

**Principle:** You can start tracking real metrics now. Not everything, but the core pipeline and retention numbers that tell you if the motion is working.

## What to Track at Stabilize

| Metric | Why It Matters | Target/Benchmark |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| **MQL Production** | Is marketing generating leads? | Track trend, not absolute number |
| **MQL→SQL Conversion** | Are leads qualified? | 10% (Series A benchmark) |
| **SQL→CW Conversion** | Can you close? | 20% (Series A benchmark) |
| **Sales Cycle Time** | How long does it take? | ~2 quarters (Series A benchmark) |
| **First Rep Quota Attainment** | Is the motion repeatable? | First rep hitting 80%+ = good sign |
| **Gross Retention** | Are customers staying? | 85-95% (90%+ is strong) |
| **Net Retention** | Including expansion? | 100-120% (Series A: 120% for sales-led) |
| **Pipeline Coverage** | Do you have enough deals? | 3-4x coverage on quota |

*Benchmarks from LeanScale Growth Model — Series A Sales-Led: $45K ACV, $600K quota, 2Q sales cycle.*

## What's New vs. Build Stage

| Metric | Build Stage | Stabilize Stage |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **MQL Production** | Skip | Track |
| **Conversion rates** | Basic | By stage |
| **Cycle time** | Skip | Track |
| **Rep productivity** | N/A | First rep metrics |
| **Gross retention** | Skip | Track (you have enough data now) |
| **Pipeline coverage** | Informal | Formal |

## What NOT to Measure Yet

- **Net Retention** — Not enough expansion data yet
- **CAC Payback** — Sample sizes still too small
- **Magic Number** — Premature efficiency metrics
- **Segment-specific benchmarks** — You don't have enough segment data
