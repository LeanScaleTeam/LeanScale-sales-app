## What to Skip at Platform Stage

These don't require primary focus at Platform stage — organizations at this stage should manage these rather than build them:

- **Rebuilding from scratch** — optimize and govern what exists; wholesale rebuilds are expensive and disruptive
- **Founder-led sales (unless strategic)** — founders should be on strategic deals only, not in pipeline
- **Tool experiments** — new tools need clear ROI and governance approval; experimentation is expensive
- **Dramatic org restructures** — stability enables execution; constant reorgs create churn
- **Manual processes** — anything still manual at Platform stage should be automated or outsourced
- **Single-point-of-failure knowledge** — if one person leaving breaks something, document and cross-train
- **Under-investing in data** — data quality and architecture are foundational; don't defer investment
- **Ignoring governance** — governance feels like overhead until a compliance issue or M&A due diligence
