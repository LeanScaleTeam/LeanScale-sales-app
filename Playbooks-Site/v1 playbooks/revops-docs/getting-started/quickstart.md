# Quickstart

Getting started with RevOps Docs.

RevOps Docs are a simple way to navigate all of the Go-to-Market and revenue best practices as you're building your startup. Get started with one of our sections below.

If you don't know where to start, we'd strongly suggest the [Growth Model](/revops-docs/growth-modeling/building-a-growth-model) section. This is the core of where to start each time you need to re-architect the way you generate revenue. It helps you know where to focus attention, your time is limited—so this ensures you're focused on the right problem at the right time.

## The RevOps Flywheel

We refer to this process of iteration the RevOps Flywheel:

1. **Adjust or Start with the Growth Model**
   - Create a plan to get from $X-ARR to $Y-ARR Revenue → Bookings → Pipeline → Leads → Awareness

2. **Augment the Growth Infrastructure**
   - Adjust systems, tools, processes, and structures to accommodate growth plan

3. **Analyze Performance to Growth Model**
   - Measure key assumptions in the plan and see what's working or not

4. **Align on Growth Drivers**
   - Align on what's working or not and what should be tested next / then back to step one
