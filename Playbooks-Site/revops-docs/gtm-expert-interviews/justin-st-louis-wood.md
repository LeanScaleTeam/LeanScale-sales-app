## Overview

This interview features Justin St. Louis Wood, a revenue operations leader at Novisto who specializes in building scalable systems for fast-growing SaaS companies. The discussion covers transitioning from foundational operations to AI-enhanced go-to-market strategies.

## Core Frameworks

### Three Pillars of Modern Revenue Systems

1. **Volume (Activity)**: Quality and depth of account executive meetings, discovery sessions, technical assessments, and buying-center engagement
2. **Accounts (Quality)**: Tiered targeting approach (Tier 1-3), appropriate seniority levels, clear pain points, and prevention of pipeline bloat
3. **Accuracy/Validation**: Clean categorization of business opportunities with automated checks and leadership oversight

### Metrics Architecture - Three Levels

**Level 1 - Northstar KPIs:**
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) targets
- Net Revenue Retention
- Net Promoter Score
- Talent retention rates

**Level 2 - Functional KPIs:**
- Marketing: Lead volume and qualified pipeline creation
- Sales: Deal quality, stage progression, opportunity validation
- Customer Success: Expansion pipeline, gross/net retention

**Level 3 - Activity Level:**
- Individual rep performance metrics
- Meeting type categorization
- Prospecting quality assessment

### Data Infrastructure Approach

Rather than maintaining multiple dashboards per department, Wood advocates for a "data skeleton"—a unified system containing 50-60 interconnected metrics across all functions. This approach:

- Consolidates information from disparate systems
- Enables cross-functional visibility
- Can be built in spreadsheets with API connectors or BI platforms
- Maintains automated, real-time data flows

## AI Implementation Strategy

### Building vs. Optimizing

Wood emphasizes distinguishing between two approaches:

- **Path 1**: "Build entirely new capabilities that weren't previously possible"
- **Path 2**: Augment existing processes incrementally

He prioritizes Path 1, focusing on creating proprietary solutions rather than marginal efficiency improvements.

### Practical Example: MSA Extraction Tool

Built using Replit and Python with AI overlays, this system:

- Reads PDF contracts automatically
- Extracts revenue figures by year, contacts, and legal clauses
- Pushes data into HubSpot, Zuora, and financial systems
- Eliminates manual data entry across multiple teams

### Human-AI Collaboration Model

- AI handles repetitive, low-leverage tasks
- Transform outputs into structured formats (JSON) for downstream automation
- Maintain human oversight at final approval stages
- Focus on enabling tasks previously impossible at scale

## Career Journey and Philosophy

Wood's background spans finance, startups, and operations roles. He emphasizes:

- **Compound gains**: Small, consistent improvements yield substantial results over time
- **Systems thinking**: Applies operational frameworks to all domains
- **Stage-appropriate processes**: Match operational complexity to company maturity
- **Delegation mindset**: Reassess what humans should do versus what AI can handle

"Small consistent habits get you to where you want to be. It's not the big wins, it's the small wins that snowball over time."

## Key Takeaways

1. Establish foundational systems before layering advanced techniques
2. Build a unified measurement framework across go-to-market functions
3. Prioritize opportunity quality over volume in sales processes
4. Design AI-first solutions rather than optimizing existing workflows
5. Maintain human judgment in validation and strategic decision-making
