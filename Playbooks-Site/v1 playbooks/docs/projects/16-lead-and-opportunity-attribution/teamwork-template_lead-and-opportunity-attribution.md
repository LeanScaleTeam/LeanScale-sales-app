### Task List: (Lead & Opportunity Attribution) 1. Discovery & Tracking Infrastructure
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Audit Current CRM Lead Source and Campaign Data | 2.5h | Assess what touchpoint data is currently captured in the CRM and identify data quality gaps. End state: Documented inventory of existing lead source values, campaign tracking fields, and data completeness percentages.<br /><br />• Pull list of all Lead Source picklist values and analyze distribution across last 6 months of leads<br />• Identify inconsistent or duplicate source values (e.g., "Google" vs "google" vs "Google Ads" vs "Paid Search")<br />• Audit Campaign object usage: count campaigns created, campaign member records, and influence tracking<br />• Document which touchpoint data is captured vs missing (first touch, subsequent touches, offline events)<br />• Quantify data quality gaps (e.g., "35% of leads have blank Lead Source")<br />• Export sample of 20-30 closed-won opportunities and manually trace their touchpoint history |
| 2. Map the Buyer Journey with Stakeholders | 2h | Interview marketing and sales to document the typical touchpoints from first interaction to closed-won. End state: Visual buyer journey map showing key touchpoints and conversion milestones.<br /><br />• Schedule 45-60 min buyer journey mapping session with marketing (Demand Gen, Content) and sales leadership<br />• Document common first-touch channels (paid search, organic, events, referrals, outbound)<br />• Identify key conversion milestones: first touch, lead creation, MQL, SQL, opportunity creation, closed-won<br />• Map typical touchpoints between milestones (nurture emails, webinars, sales calls, content downloads)<br />• Note differences in journey by segment (enterprise vs SMB, inbound vs outbound)<br />• Create visual journey map showing touchpoints at each stage for stakeholder alignment |
| 3. Evaluate and Select Attribution Model | 2.5h | Analyze attribution model options against client's sales cycle and business needs, then recommend the appropriate model. End state: Attribution model selected and documented with stakeholder buy-in.<br /><br />• Review attribution model options: first-touch, last-touch, linear, U-shaped, W-shaped, time-decay<br />• Analyze client's average sales cycle length (short cycles favor simpler models; 6+ month cycles need multi-touch)<br />• Consider buying committee complexity (multiple stakeholders require account-level attribution)<br />• Evaluate CRM/MA native attribution capabilities (Salesforce Campaign Influence vs custom solution)<br />• Present recommendation with pros/cons to VP Marketing and RevOps<br />• Document selected model rationale and get stakeholder sign-off |
| 4. Standardize UTM Taxonomy and Tracking URLs | 3h | Create a consistent UTM parameter taxonomy and tracking URL templates for all marketing campaigns. End state: Documented UTM taxonomy with templates and tracking URL builder for marketing team.<br /><br />• Define UTM parameter standards: utm_source (channel), utm_medium (type), utm_campaign (campaign name), utm_content (variation)<br />• Create standardized naming conventions (lowercase, underscores, no spaces)<br />• Build tracking URL template spreadsheet or tool (e.g., Google Sheets UTM builder)<br />• Document taxonomy rules with examples for each channel (paid search, social, email, events)<br />• Review existing URLs and campaigns for compliance; flag inconsistencies for cleanup<br />• Train marketing team on UTM standards and URL builder usage |
| 5. Configure Lead Source Normalization Rules | 3h | Build lead source normalization logic to consolidate inconsistent source values into clean categories. End state: Automated normalization rules that clean lead source data on ingest.<br /><br />• Create master Lead Source taxonomy with 10-15 clean values (e.g., Paid Search, Organic Search, Referral, Event, Outbound)<br />• Map existing messy values to clean categories (e.g., "Google" + "google ads" + "adwords" → "Paid Search")<br />• Build normalization automation in CRM (Salesforce Flow, HubSpot Workflow, or Marketo Smart Campaign)<br />• Configure rules to run on lead creation and update<br />• Test normalization with sample records; verify correct categorization<br />• Document normalization logic for ongoing maintenance |
| 6. Implement Touchpoint Capture on Lead/Contact Records | 3.5h | Configure fields and automation to capture first-touch and subsequent touchpoints on Lead and Contact records. End state: All new leads have first-touch source/campaign populated; subsequent touches tracked via campaign membership.<br /><br />• Create custom fields for first-touch attribution: First Touch Source, First Touch Campaign, First Touch Date<br />• Build automation to stamp first-touch fields on lead creation (only if blank)<br />• Configure campaign member tracking to log subsequent touchpoints<br />• Set up hidden form fields to capture UTM parameters and pass to CRM<br />• Implement web-to-lead or form handler integration to preserve UTM data<br />• Test end-to-end: submit test form with UTM parameters, verify data flows to CRM fields |

### Task List: (Lead & Opportunity Attribution) 2. Configuration & Enablement
**Contains:** Parts 3-4

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 7. Set Up Multi-Touch Attribution Logic | 3.5h | Configure the selected attribution model in the CRM using campaign influence or custom attribution objects. End state: Attribution logic operational and assigning credit to touchpoints on opportunities.<br /><br />• If Salesforce: Enable Customizable Campaign Influence and configure influence model (primary vs multi-touch)<br />• If HubSpot: Configure multi-touch revenue attribution reports with selected model<br />• Set attribution lookback window (e.g., 90 days, 180 days) based on sales cycle length<br />• Configure touchpoint weighting per selected model (e.g., W-shaped: 30/30/30/10)<br />• Build custom attribution object if native capabilities insufficient (junction object linking Opportunity to Campaigns with credit %)<br />• Document attribution logic configuration for troubleshooting and future modifications |
| 8. Create Opportunity-to-Campaign Linkage | 3.5h | Build the connection between opportunities and influencing campaigns to attribute pipeline and revenue. End state: Opportunities linked to all influencing campaigns with credit allocated per model.<br /><br />• Configure Contact Role requirements on opportunities (essential for campaign influence to work)<br />• Set up automatic campaign member to opportunity association via Contact Roles<br />• Build automation to create Campaign Influence records when opportunities are created<br />• Configure influence credit calculation based on selected attribution model<br />• Test with sample opportunities: verify campaigns are linked and credit is allocated correctly<br />• Validate that influenced pipeline and revenue roll up to Campaign object |
| 9. Test Attribution Data Accuracy | 2h | Validate attribution logic by reconciling sample deals against known touchpoint history. End state: Confirmed accuracy of attribution data with documented test results.<br /><br />• Select 10-15 recently closed-won opportunities with known marketing touchpoints<br />• Manually trace each opportunity's touchpoint history from first touch to close<br />• Compare manual trace to CRM attribution data; identify discrepancies<br />• Investigate and fix root causes of discrepancies (missing campaign members, broken automation)<br />• Re-test after fixes; document final accuracy rate<br />• Sign off on attribution accuracy with marketing stakeholder |
