## AI Agent Recommendations

**Stage-appropriate approach:** AI agents at Scale handle volume and consistency challenges. Automated agents keep processes running at scale. Work agents help leaders and specialists with analysis and strategy.

## Automated Agents (Headless)

| Use Case | Trigger | Output | SOP Required |
|----------|---------|--------|--------------|
| **Lead routing** | New lead in CRM | Assigned to right rep/queue | Lead routing rules |
| **Data enrichment** | New contact/account | Enriched record | Enrichment SOP |
| **Activity logging** | Meeting/call completed | Activity in CRM | Logging standards |
| **Report generation** | Scheduled (daily/weekly) | Dashboards updated | Report specs |
| **Health score updates** | Usage data changes | Health score recalculated | Health model |
| **Renewal alerts** | Days to renewal threshold | Alert to CSM/manager | Renewal process |
| **Pipeline hygiene** | Stale opportunity detection | Alert or auto-archive | Pipeline rules |

## Work Agents (Interactive)

| Use Case | Who Uses | Example Prompt |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Forecast analysis** | Sales leader | "Analyze our current pipeline and identify deals likely to slip. Flag where MEDDIC is incomplete." |
| **Deal strategy** | AE/Manager | "Review this enterprise opportunity. What risks do you see? What should I do differently?" |
| **Territory modeling** | RevOps | "Model three territory scenarios based on this account list and rep capacity." |
| **Campaign analysis** | Marketing | "Analyze performance of our webinar series. What's working? What should we stop?" |
| **Churn analysis** | CS leader | "Analyze our churned accounts from Q4. What patterns do you see?" |
| **Competitive positioning** | Sales/PMM | "Based on these competitor mentions in calls, what positioning adjustments should we make?" |
| **Process design** | RevOps | "Draft a stage gate process for our sales stages. Include entry/exit criteria." |

## What's New at Scale (vs. Stabilize)

| Capability | Why It Emerges |
|------------|---------------|
| **Forecast agents** | Pipeline volume makes forecasting meaningful |
| **Territory agents** | Multiple reps need balanced territories |
| **Health scoring automation** | Customer count requires automated scoring |
| **Reporting automation** | Report volume requires automation |
| **Competitive intel agents** | Enough call volume for pattern detection |

## Implementation Guidance

- **Start with high-volume tasks** — enrichment, routing, logging save the most time
- **Build SOPs first** — agents execute SOPs, can't work without them
- **Monitor quality** — automated doesn't mean unmonitored
- **Iterate** — agents improve with feedback and refinement

**What NOT to do:**

- **AI for AI's sake** — automation should solve real problems
- **Skip the SOP** — agents without SOPs produce garbage
- **No human oversight** — especially on customer-facing outputs
- **Over-reliance early** — agents augment, don't replace judgment
