## Marketing Processes

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Marketing at Optimize is about efficiency and segment specialization. Programs exist — now they get optimized for CAC, attribution, and segment-specific ROI. ABM becomes essential for enterprise. Marketing Ops is a mature function.

## Content Strategy

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Segment-specific content with clear attribution. Not just "more content" but "right content for right segment at right stage." Content production is systematized with measurement.

**Content by segment:**

| Segment | Content Focus | Format Priority | Distribution |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Enterprise** | Strategic, executive-level, industry-specific | Whitepapers, research, executive briefs | ABM, 1:1 outreach, events |
| **Mid-Market** | Use-case focused, ROI-oriented | Case studies, webinars, guides | Demand gen, nurture, SDR outreach |
| **SMB** | Practical, implementation-focused | Templates, how-tos, short videos | Self-serve, product-led, email |

**Content efficiency metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Signal |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Content-influenced pipeline** | Increasing | Content driving deals |
| **Asset engagement by segment** | Segment-appropriate | Right content reaching right people |
| **Production cost per asset** | Stable or decreasing | Efficiency improving |
| **Content reuse ratio** | High | Getting leverage from investments |

**Content operations at Optimize:**

- **Content calendar** — 90-day rolling view, segment-tagged
- **Content scoring** — which assets drive outcomes
- **Repurposing workflow** — one research piece becomes multiple assets
- **AI augmentation** — AI assists research, drafts, and repurposing
- **Localization** — if multi-geo, translation workflows

**What NOT to do:**
- **Generic content for all segments** — wastes budget, low conversion
- **Volume over quality** — 10 great assets beat 50 mediocre ones
- **No measurement** — content without attribution is guesswork

## Website & Positioning

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Segment-specific landing pages and conversion paths. Homepage serves navigation; segment pages serve conversion. Positioning is refined and consistent across channels.

**Website architecture at Optimize:**

| Page Type | Purpose | Optimization Focus |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Homepage** | Navigation, brand | Clear paths to segment pages |
| **Segment landing pages** | Conversion | Messaging by segment, CTAs by intent |
| **Use case pages** | Education + conversion | Deep content, bottom-of-funnel CTAs |
| **Pricing page** | Qualification | Segment-appropriate tiers, enterprise CTA |
| **Resource center** | Engagement | Gated strategically, ungated for awareness |

**Conversion optimization:**

| Element | Optimization Approach |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Forms** | Progressive profiling, segment-appropriate fields |
| **CTAs** | Segment-specific, intent-based ("Request Demo" vs "Start Free Trial") |
| **Chat/bot** | Qualification + routing, segment detection |
| **Personalization** | Account-based personalization for enterprise, behavior-based for others |

**Positioning consistency:**

- **Message testing** — regular testing by segment
- **Competitive positioning** — documented, updated quarterly
- **Sales-marketing alignment** — website messaging matches sales conversations
- **Brand guidelines** — enforced but efficient

**What NOT to do:**
- **One-size-fits-all landing pages** — kill conversion rates
- **Over-gating content** — balances shift at Optimize
- **Constant redesigns** — optimize, don't rebuild

## Demand Gen / Paid

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Optimized CAC with segment-specific programs. Not just "spend more" but "spend smarter." Channel mix is data-driven. Attribution is reliable enough to make decisions.

**Demand gen by segment:**

| Segment | Primary Channels | Secondary Channels | CAC Target |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Enterprise** | ABM, events, executive programs | Content syndication (targeted) | Higher CAC acceptable (higher LTV) |
| **Mid-Market** | Paid search, paid social, content syndication | Email, SEO, webinars | Moderate CAC |
| **SMB** | Paid search, SEO, product-led | Social, community, referral | Lower CAC required |

**Channel optimization at Optimize:**

| Activity | What It Involves |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Channel efficiency analysis** | CAC, conversion rates, velocity by channel |
| **Budget reallocation** | Shift budget to efficient channels |
| **Creative testing** | Systematic A/B testing |
| **Audience refinement** | Tighter targeting based on conversion data |
| **Attribution modeling** | Multi-touch attribution to inform decisions |

**CAC optimization levers:**

| Lever | How It Works |
|-------|-------------|
| **Channel mix** | More budget to efficient channels |
| **Targeting precision** | Tighter ICP = higher conversion |
| **Conversion rate** | Better landing pages = lower CAC |
| **Sales efficiency** | Faster cycles = lower blended CAC |
| **Content leverage** | Organic growth reduces paid dependence |

**What NOT to do:**
- **Spreading budget too thin** — focus beats diversification at this stage
- **Ignoring attribution** — can't optimize what isn't measured
- **Chasing volume over efficiency** — leads that don't convert hurt unit economics

## Community & Network

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Advocacy programs and customer community. Move from "building community" to "leveraging community" — customer advocates, user groups, peer networks.

**Community maturity at Optimize:**

| Element | What It Looks Like |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Customer community** | Active user groups, forums, or Slack community |
| **Advocacy program** | Formal program with benefits and recognition |
| **Peer connections** | Facilitated customer-to-customer connections |
| **User groups** | Geographic or industry-specific meetups |
| **Champions program** | Internal champions at customer accounts |

**Advocacy program structure:**

| Tier | Activities | Benefits |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Engaged** | Product feedback, community participation | Early access, community recognition |
| **Advocate** | Reviews, references, peer conversations | Swag, exclusive events, advisory input |
| **Champion** | Case studies, speaking, co-marketing | Executive access, influence on roadmap |

**Community metrics:**

| Metric | What It Signals |
|--------|----------------|
| **Active members** | Community health |
| **Engagement rate** | Value delivery |
| **Advocate-influenced pipeline** | Business impact |
| **Reference availability** | Advocate program health |
| **NPS from community members** | Advocacy correlation |

**What NOT to do:**
- **Community without value** — if members aren't getting value, it won't work
- **Over-extracting** — too many asks, not enough give
- **Ignoring executive sponsors** — C-level advocates are high value

## Event Strategy

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Owned events and strategic presence. Move from "attending events" to "owning events" — user conferences, executive dinners, industry leadership.

**Event portfolio at Optimize:**

| Event Type | Purpose | Investment Level |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| **User conference** | Customer retention, expansion, advocacy | Major (consider launching if not yet) |
| **Executive dinners** | Enterprise pipeline, relationship | Medium |
| **Industry conferences** | Brand, awareness, pipeline | Selective, strategic |
| **Field events** | Regional pipeline, customer engagement | Medium |
| **Virtual events** | Scale, efficiency | Ongoing |

**Owned event consideration:**

| Factor | Ready for User Conference | Not Ready |
|--------|--------------------------|-----------|
| **Customer count** | 200+ customers | Fewer than 100 |
| **Customer engagement** | High community activity | Low engagement |
| **Brand strength** | Known in market | Still establishing |
| **Content depth** | Rich customer stories | Limited case studies |
| **Resources** | Can invest $200K-$500K+ | Budget constrained |

**Event ROI optimization:**

| Lever | How It Works |
|-------|-------------|
| **Pipeline targets** | Clear targets per event |
| **Pre-event outreach** | Meeting booking before events |
| **Content capture** | Speaker content, testimonials at events |
| **Post-event follow-up** | Rapid follow-up workflow |
| **Multi-purpose** | Events serve multiple goals (pipeline + customer + brand) |

**What NOT to do:**
- **Events without measurement** — must tie to pipeline and customer outcomes
- **Over-investing in vanity** — brand presence without pipeline return
- **Under-investing in customer events** — user conferences drive retention + expansion

## ABM

**Stage-appropriate approach:** ABM becomes essential for enterprise segment at Optimize. Move from "consider ABM" to "ABM is a core program." 1:Few ABM for enterprise accounts, 1:Many for mid-market.

**ABM program structure at Optimize:**

| Tier | Target Accounts | Approach | Team Effort |
|------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| **1:1 ABM** | 10-25 strategic accounts | Fully custom, executive engagement | AE + SDR + Marketing + Leadership |
| **1:Few ABM** | 50-150 enterprise accounts | Cluster-based, industry-specific | AE + SDR + Marketing |
| **1:Many ABM** | 500-2000 mid-market accounts | Programmatic, personalized at scale | Marketing + SDR support |

**ABM infrastructure:**

| Component | What's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Account selection** | Data-driven tiering, ICP scoring |
| **Intent data** | Signals on account activity |
| **Account intelligence** | Company info, buying committee, triggers |
| **Personalization** | Website, ads, content personalization by account |
| **Measurement** | Account-level engagement, pipeline, velocity |

**ABM metrics:**

| Metric | What It Tells |
|--------|---------------|
| **Account engagement score** | Program effectiveness |
| **Buying committee coverage** | Multi-threading success |
| **ABM-influenced pipeline** | Program ROI |
| **ABM win rate vs non-ABM** | Incremental impact |
| **Velocity: ABM vs non-ABM** | Sales cycle impact |

**What NOT to do:**
- **ABM without sales alignment** — sales must be fully bought in
- **Too many 1:1 accounts** — dilutes effort, reduces impact
- **No measurement** — ABM without attribution is expensive brand advertising
- **Ignoring existing customers** — ABM for expansion, not just acquisition

| **Campaign launch time** | Decreasing |
| **Data quality score** | >90% completeness |
| **Attribution coverage** | >80% of pipeline |
| **Tool utilization** | Features used vs purchased |

**What NOT to do:**
- **Ops as afterthought** — Ops enables marketing efficiency
- **Tool proliferation** — consolidate, don't add
- **Manual processes at scale** — automate repeatable workflows
- **Ignoring data quality** — bad data = bad decisions

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Partner marketing becomes active at Optimize. Co-marketing with technology partners. Channel marketing if channel program exists. Joint demand gen programs.

| **Co-marketing ROI** | Return on partner marketing investment |

- **MDF without accountability** — tie funds to outcomes
- **Ignoring attribution** — must measure partner contribution
- **One-sided relationships** — marketing should benefit both parties
