### Task List: (Opp UX) 1. Assessment & Design
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Audit Current Opportunity Page Layouts | 2h | Document all visible fields, sections, and related lists across each opportunity record type. End state: Complete inventory of current layout configuration with field counts and section structure.<br /><br />• Export list of all opportunity page layouts and their profile assignments from Setup<br />• Screenshot or document each page layout section by section (top to bottom)<br />• Count total fields per layout and identify fields above vs. below the fold<br />• Document all related lists displayed and their column configurations<br />• Note any dynamic forms, conditional visibility rules, or record type variations<br />• Map which profiles/roles use which page layouts |
| 2. Analyze Field Usage Data | 2h | Pull quantitative data on field completion rates to identify unused or underutilized fields. End state: Field usage report showing completion percentages for every opportunity field.<br /><br />• Run Salesforce Optimizer or install Field Trip app to analyze field usage<br />• Pull field completion rates for all opportunity fields over last 90-180 days<br />• Flag fields with &lt;10% completion rate as candidates for removal<br />• Identify fields with >80% identical values (potential for defaults)<br />• Cross-reference low-usage fields with active reports and dashboards<br />• Export findings to spreadsheet for prioritization in next step |

End state: Layout blueprint document showing field placement decisions and rationale.<br /><br />• Categorize fields into: Must-Have (top), Should-Have (middle), Archive (bottom)<br />• Apply the "8 out of 10" rule: if a field isn't used on 80% of records, move it down<br />• Group related fields into logical sections (Deal Details, Contact Info, Forecasting)<br />• Decide which fields to remove entirely vs. archive in collapsed section<br />• Document rationale for each field placement decision<br />• Get stakeholder sign-off on proposed field hierarchy before building |
| 6. Configure Compact Layouts | 1.5h | Set up compact layouts to display the 5 most critical fields in record highlights. End state: Compact layouts configured showing Amount, Stage, Close Date, Next Step, and Owner.<br /><br />• Navigate to Object Manager > Opportunity > Compact Layouts<br />• Create new compact layout with top 5 fields (Amount, Stage, Close Date, Next Step, Owner)<br />• Assign compact layout to appropriate record types<br />• Test compact layout appears correctly in record highlights and related lists<br />• Verify mobile display shows correct compact layout fields |
| 7. Design Quick Actions for Common Tasks | 2h | Create quick actions that reduce clicks for frequent rep activities. End state: 3-4 quick actions configured for log activity, update stage, schedule follow-up.<br /><br />• Identify 3-4 most common rep actions from interview findings<br />• Create Quick Action: "Log Activity" with minimal required fields<br />• Create Quick Action: "Update Stage" with stage picklist and next step<br />• Create Quick Action: "Schedule Follow-up" with date picker and activity type<br />• Configure action layouts with only essential fields (no clutter)<br />• Test each quick action in sandbox to verify smooth workflow |
