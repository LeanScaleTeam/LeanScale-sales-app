## Key Concepts

- **Enrichable ICP:** ICP criteria that Clay data providers can actually populate (vs theoretical criteria)
- **Account Tiering:** T1 (slam dunks) → T2 (good fits) → T3 (maybe fits) based on fit score thresholds
- **Valuation:** Estimated ARR potential per account for equitable territory design
- **Personas:** Tier 1/2/3 contacts at accounts - the people you actually reach out to
- **The Clay Use Case Pyramid:** Market Map is the foundation all other Clay workflows build on

## When to Use This Project

**Good fit:**
- SLG (Sales-Led Growth) B2B company
- Scaling outbound, hiring new reps
- Need fair territory allocation based on actual account value
- Want to stop enriching accounts that don't matter
- Need TAM visibility for funding rounds or board reporting

**Prerequisites:**
- Admin access to CRM (Salesforce/HubSpot)
- Active Clay subscription with minimum 10k credits
- 2-3 hours of stakeholder time for ICP/Persona workshops
- Clear on target geographies and industries

**Related Projects:**
- Automated Inbound (uses Market Map to check fit before enrichment)
- Signal Workflows (filters against Market Map for T1 prioritization)
- Territory Design (uses account valuations from Market Map)

## The Gold Miner Metaphor

Three miners sent to three mountains. One returns with nuggets, one with a wheelbarrow, one with a trainload. You blame the first, praise the second, promote the third.

**But why didn't you figure out how much gold was in each mountain first?**

Market Map solves this. Before assigning territories, you know where the gold is.
