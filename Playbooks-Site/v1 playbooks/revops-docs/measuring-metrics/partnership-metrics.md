# Partnership Metrics

This guide covers how to measure partnership and channel team performance using a cross-functional approach across the entire go-to-market lifecycle.

## Key Metrics to Track

### Bookings

Monitor progress toward partnership revenue targets by tracking the total contract value signed with new customers acquired through partner channels.

### Pipeline

Measure the cumulative value of sales opportunities in the pipeline that originated from partner-generated leads.

### SQLs (Sales Qualified Leads)

Track the quantity of qualified leads delivered by partners to your sales team when lead generation is a primary partnership objective.

### Funnel Metrics

Analyze for partner-sourced deals:
- Sales cycle length
- Conversion rates
- Customer lifecycle stages

This helps assess partnership effectiveness.

### Partnership Health

Implement a status system managed by partner managers:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Green** | Partnership thriving |
| **Yellow** | Needs attention |
| **Red** | Requires intervention |

This enables quick identification of partnership performance.

### Customer Lifecycle Stages

Compare across different partners:
- Onboarding metrics
- Implementation metrics
- Early adoption metrics

This identifies performance variations between partners.

### Cost to Carry Ratios

Calculate the total cost of partnership management:
- Partner managers
- Marketing support
- Customer success resources

Use this to forecast future resource needs.

## Key Takeaway

By monitoring these metrics systematically, teams gain visibility into partnership performance and can make data-driven adjustments to their channel strategy.
