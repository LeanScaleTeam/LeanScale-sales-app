# Customer Success Metrics

This guide covers essential customer success metrics that help businesses measure retention effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

## Net Retention Rate (NRR)

Tracks how much revenue you keep from existing customers over a specific period.

NRR factors in:
- **Expansion revenue**: Customers increasing spending
- **Contraction revenue**: Customers decreasing spending

A strong NRR indicates effective value delivery.

## Gross Retention Rate (GRR)

Measures customer continuation without accounting for expansion or contraction.

GRR reflects your efficacy in retaining customers and serves as a benchmark for satisfaction levels.

## Customer Health

Health scoring uses multiple methods:

| Method | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| Satisfaction surveys | Direct feedback on experience |
| Support ticket analysis | Issue frequency and resolution |
| Product usage data | Engagement and adoption levels |

These indicators reveal how satisfied customers are with your product or service.

## Customer Lifecycle Stages

The framework identifies eight progression stages:

1. **Awareness** - Customer discovers your product
2. **Acquisition** - Customer signs up or purchases
3. **Onboarding** - Initial setup and training
4. **Implementation** - Full deployment
5. **Early adoption** - First usage patterns emerge
6. **Growth** - Expanded usage and value realization
7. **Retention** - Ongoing engagement and renewal
8. **Churn** - Customer departure

Understanding these stages helps identify improvement opportunities.

## Cost to Carry Ratios

These ratios examine support expenses relative to revenue generated, revealing customer profitability dynamics.

Key questions to answer:
- How much does it cost to support each customer segment?
- Which customers generate the best margins?

## Survey Data

Methods for gathering direct customer feedback:

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: Likelihood to recommend
- **Satisfaction surveys**: Overall experience rating
- **Usage surveys**: Feature adoption and preferences

## Key Takeaway

Consistent metric monitoring enables data-driven improvements to customer retention strategies.
