## Overview

This page features a transcript and summary of a GTM tech demo showcasing Spara, a multimodal AI platform for inbound go-to-market automation founded by David Walker.

## Key Topics

### Problem and Solution

- **Challenge**: Buyers visit websites but companies lack fast, contextual engagement to answer questions and capture intent
- **Solution**: AI-powered platform that engages customers across multiple channels simultaneously while maintaining consistency

### Core Differentiator: Multimodal AI

Spara allows companies to train a single AI model on their data and deploy it across:

- Chat (Navigator and Smart Bar interfaces)
- Email (fully autonomous, real-time responses)
- Voice (pre-call preparation and buyer conditioning)

## Product Features

### Navigator

Free-form AI chat without gating, delivering "2-4x greater engagement" versus traditional static chatbots.

### Smart Bar

Website-embedded interface providing "chat GPT for your website," capturing proprietary intent data through natural questions.

### Email Automation

Real-time autonomous email with conversation context, closing latency gaps.

### Voice Integration

Pre-demo calls that prepare buyers by clarifying goals without replacing human sellers.

## Training Approach

- Start with public data (website, documentation, knowledge bases)
- Use internal transcripts and sales training materials
- Human-in-the-loop testing interface for refinement
- "No new asset creation typically required"

## Business Impact

- Intent-driven routing to appropriate sales channels (AE, SDR, or self-serve)
- CRM integration with Slack alerts and lead enrichment
- Positions as "the AI layer powering sales and marketing"
