## Marketing Processes

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Marketing becomes a real function at Scale — not just a person, but a team with specialization. Demand generation is no longer experimental; it's a scaled program with measurable contribution. ABM becomes relevant for enterprise segments.

## Content Strategy

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Scaled content production. The founder voice is still valuable but content can no longer be founder-only. A content engine with consistent output is the goal.

**Content structure at Scale:**

| Content Type | Frequency | Owner | Purpose |
|--------------|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Blog posts** | 2-4/month | Content lead | SEO, thought leadership |
| **Case studies** | 1-2/month | Content + CS | Social proof |
| **eBooks/guides** | 1/quarter | Content | Gated lead gen |
| **Webinars** | 1-2/month | Marketing + Product | Lead gen, education |
| **Product content** | Ongoing | PMM | Feature adoption |
| **Sales enablement** | Ongoing | Marketing + Sales | Rep support |

**Content production model:**

- **Content calendar** — 90-day rolling plan, monthly review
- **Content briefs** — documented requirements before production starts
- **Review process** — clear approvers, reasonable turnaround
- **Distribution plan** — where each piece goes, not just "publish and pray"

**Content by funnel stage:**

| Funnel Stage | Content Focus | Examples |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Awareness** | Thought leadership, trends | Blog, LinkedIn, podcasts |
| **Interest** | Problem education | Webinars, guides |
| **Consideration** | Solution comparison | Case studies, demos |
| **Decision** | Proof and urgency | ROI calculators, references |

**What NOT to do:**

- **Founder-only content** — unsustainable and creates bottleneck
- **No SEO strategy** — content without distribution is waste
- **Feature announcements as "content"** — customers care about outcomes, not features
- **Zero repurposing** — one piece should become many formats

## Website and Positioning

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Website is optimized, not just "good enough." Conversion rate matters. Positioning is refined and tested. The site is now a real lead gen channel, not just a brochure.

**Website optimization at Scale:**

| Element | What Changes | Why It Matters |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Homepage** | Segment-specific messaging options | Different visitors need different entry points |
| **Navigation** | Persona/segment paths | Reduce friction to relevant content |
| **Forms** | Progressive profiling | Capture more data over time, not all at once |
| **Social proof** | Segment-matched logos/testimonials | "Companies like you" credibility |
| **CTAs** | Segmented offers | Different actions for different buyers |

**Conversion optimization:**

- **Form performance tracking** — conversion rates by form, field analysis
- **A/B testing program** — continuous testing of key pages
- **Chatbot/live chat** — if appropriate for motion, with routing logic
- **Analytics rigor** — UTM discipline, attribution clarity

**Positioning refinement:**

- **Competitive differentiation** — clear "why us vs. them" messaging
- **Segment-specific value props** — what matters to SMB ≠ enterprise
- **Messaging testing** — validate headlines and value props with data

**What NOT to do:**

- **Redesign for redesign's sake** — optimize, don't overhaul without reason
- **Ignore mobile** — significant traffic is mobile, even in B2B
- **Hide pricing** — if competitors show pricing, opacity costs leads
- **Generic testimonials** — "Great product!" says nothing

## Demand Generation and Paid Acquisition

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Scaled programs with real budgets. Marketing is now accountable for pipeline contribution. Channel mix is diversified, not just one bet.

**Demand gen at Scale:**

| Channel | Maturity Level | Investment Level |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| **Paid search** | Optimized, scaled | 30-50% of paid budget |
| **Paid social** | Active, segmented | 20-30% of paid budget |
| **Content syndication** | Testing or scaled | 10-20% of paid budget |
| **Retargeting** | Active | 10-15% of paid budget |
| **ABM advertising** | If enterprise segment | 15-25% of paid budget |

**Budget and accountability:**

- **Marketing budget as % of revenue** — typically 10-20% at this stage
- **Pipeline contribution target** — marketing-sourced or marketing-influenced (define which)
- **CAC tracking by channel** — know which channels actually produce ROI

**Demand gen metrics:**

| Metric | What It Measures | Typical Target |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **MQL volume** | Top of funnel production | Growth from prior period |
| **MQL→SQL conversion** | Lead quality | 30-50% |
| **Marketing-sourced pipe** | Direct attribution | 30-50% of total pipe |
| **CAC by channel** | Efficiency | Under 1/3 first-year ACV |

**Program structure:**

- **Always-on programs** — paid search, retargeting, email nurture
- **Campaign bursts** — webinars, launches, events
- **Test budget** — 10-20% for experimentation

**What NOT to do:**

- **All eggs in one channel** — diversification reduces risk
- **Vanity metrics obsession** — impressions and clicks don't pay rent
- **No attribution** — can't optimize what isn't measured
- **Budget without targets** — "more leads" isn't a goal

## Community and Network Building

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Community programs emerge. The founder network is valuable but not scalable. Customer community and industry presence become strategic.

**Community at Scale:**

| Community Type | Purpose | Investment Level |
|----------------|---------|------------------|
| **Customer community** | Peer support, engagement | Moderate (platform + moderation) |
| **User groups/chapters** | Local engagement | Low (customer-led, company-supported) |
| **Online community** | Ongoing engagement | Moderate (Slack, Circle, etc.) |
| **Partner community** | Ecosystem building | If relevant to motion |

**Community investment:**

- **Platform decision** — Slack, Circle, Discourse, community tools
- **Moderation model** — community manager role or shared responsibility
- **Content for community** — exclusive content, early access, AMAs
- **Success metrics** — engagement, retention correlation, NPS

**Network building:**

- **Analyst relations** — if relevant to enterprise sales (Gartner, Forrester)
- **Influencer relationships** — industry thought leaders, not paid endorsements
- **Customer advisory board** — early version, 5-10 strategic customers

**What NOT to do:**

- **Community as marketing channel** — communities that feel like ads die fast
- **No moderation** — unmoderated communities become ghost towns or toxic
- **Expecting community to build itself** — it takes investment and effort
- **Measuring community by leads generated** — wrong metric, wrong incentives

## Event Strategy

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Major presence at key events. Hosting becomes viable. Event ROI is tracked, not assumed.

**Event portfolio at Scale:**

| Event Type | Role | Investment Level |
|------------|------|------------------|
| **Industry conferences** | Sponsor or major presence | High (booth, speaking, dinners) |
| **Partner events** | Co-marketing | Moderate |
| **Owned events** | Webinars, virtual events | Moderate (production quality up) |
| **Field events** | Dinners, roundtables | Moderate (targeted, high-touch) |
| **Customer events** | User conference consideration | High if doing |

**Event strategy principles:**

- **Selectivity over volume** — better to do 5 events well than 15 poorly
- **Pre/post event process** — meetings booked before event, follow-up within 48 hours
- **ROI tracking** — cost per meeting, cost per opportunity, deals closed
- **Event enablement** — talking points, booth training, demo environments

**User conference consideration:**

At Scale, an annual user conference may become viable if:
- Customer count supports it (100+ customers typically)
- Strategic value justifies cost (brand, retention, expansion)
- Team can execute (event planning is a skill)

Most Scale-stage companies should attend and sponsor rather than host major events.

**What NOT to do:**

- **Spray and pray** — being at every event with no strategy
- **No follow-up process** — leads from events die without fast outreach
- **Booth without meetings** — booth presence alone doesn't drive pipeline
- **Ignoring virtual** — virtual events still matter and cost less

## ABM (Account-Based Marketing)

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Consider ABM if an enterprise segment exists. ABM is not a replacement for demand gen — it's an addition for strategic accounts.

**ABM readiness signals:**

- **Enterprise segment exists** — ACV >$50K, longer sales cycles
- **Named accounts identified** — sales has a target account list
- **Sales-marketing alignment** — shared definitions, coordinated outreach
- **Data infrastructure** — can track account-level engagement

**ABM tiers at Scale:**

| Tier | Account Count | Treatment | Typical Investment |
|------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **1:1** | 5-20 | Highly personalized, dedicated resources | High |
| **1:Few** | 20-100 | Cluster-based personalization | Medium |
| **1:Many** | 100-500+ | Scaled personalization | Lower per-account |

**Starting ABM at Scale:**

Most Scale-stage companies should start with 1:Few ABM:
- Pick 50-100 target accounts
- Create segment-specific content and ads
- Coordinate sales and marketing outreach
- Measure engagement at account level

**What NOT to do:**

- **ABM without sales buy-in** — ABM is a sales-marketing partnership, not a marketing program
- **ABM for SMB** — economics don't work for low-ACV deals
- **Over-investing before proving** — start small, prove ROI, then scale
- **Treating ABM as separate from demand gen** — it's a complement, not a replacement

## Marketing Operations

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Marketing ops becomes a real function at Scale. Somebody owns the tech stack, data quality, and process efficiency. This often reports to RevOps or is a dedicated marketing ops role.

**Marketing ops responsibilities:**

| Area | What's Owned | Typical Activities |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Tech stack** | Marketing tools | Administration, integrations, vendor management |
| **Data quality** | Marketing data | Enrichment, deduplication, hygiene |
| **Automation** | Email, workflows | Campaign execution, nurture programs |
| **Reporting** | Marketing metrics | Dashboards, attribution, analysis |
| **Process** | Marketing operations | Lead management, routing, SLAs |

**Tech stack at Scale:**

| Category | Typical Tools | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **MAP** | HubSpot Pro/Enterprise, Marketo, Pardot | Full automation capabilities |
| **ABM** | Demandbase, 6sense, Terminus | If enterprise segment |
| **Intent data** | Bombora, G2 | Identify in-market accounts |
| **Analytics** | GA4, Mixpanel | Web and product analytics |
| **Attribution** | Bizible, CaliberMind | Multi-touch attribution |

**Lead management:**

- **Lead scoring** — behavioral + demographic scoring
- **Lead routing** — automated, rules-based routing to sales
- **SLAs** — marketing-to-sales response time commitments
- **Recycling** — process for leads that don't convert

**What NOT to do:**

- **Nobody owns the stack** — tools without ownership become shelfware
- **No data governance** — garbage in, garbage out
- **Overbuying tools** — buy for current needs, not aspirational ones
- **Siloed reporting** — marketing and sales should see the same numbers

## Partner Marketing

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Consider partner marketing if technology partnerships are active. Channel partner marketing is typically Optimize stage, but tech partner co-marketing can start at Scale.

**Partner marketing at Scale:**

| Activity | When Relevant | Investment Level |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Integration marketing** | Active tech partnerships | Low-moderate |
| **Co-branded content** | Strategic partnerships | Moderate |
| **Marketplace presence** | Ecosystem play | Moderate |
| **Partner events** | Major partner events | Variable |

**What makes sense at Scale:**

- **Integration pages** — documentation and marketing for key integrations
- **Co-webinars** — shared lead gen with tech partners
- **Marketplace listings** — if relevant marketplaces exist (Salesforce AppExchange, HubSpot Marketplace, etc.)

**What to wait on:**

- **Channel partner programs** — requires partner ops infrastructure (Optimize stage)
- **Partner portal** — premature investment at Scale
- **Through-partner demand gen** — wait until partner channel is mature

**What NOT to do:**

- **Partner marketing without integration** — marketing before the product partnership exists
- **Equal investment across all partners** — prioritize by strategic value
- **No tracking** — partner-sourced vs. partner-influenced should be measured
