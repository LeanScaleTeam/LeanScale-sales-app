# Created Pipeline

## Create Pipeline to Plan (SQL Goals)

Marketing teams should monitor the creation of SQLs (Sales Qualified Leads) as a critical measure of their effectiveness. Establish clear, measurable objectives for SQL generation segmented by marketing channel and region to craft a pipeline plan. This approach enables tracking progress and facilitates necessary adaptations to achieve overall booking objectives.

### 1. Establish Clear SQL Goals

Begin by setting specific objectives for the quantity of SQLs to generate. These targets should be informed by:
- Past performance data
- Market analysis
- Overarching sales and marketing strategy goals

Ensure your aims follow the SMART framework: **Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound**.

### 2. Segment Goals by Channel and Region

After establishing SQL goals, dissect them by marketing channel and region. This granular approach reveals performance of each channel and region, guiding resource allocation to the most effective areas.

**Common marketing channels include:**
- Events
- SDRs (Sales Development Representatives)
- Paid advertising
- Referrals
- Sales-sourced SQLs

### 3. Monitor the Path and Adapt as Needed

Keep close watch on performance against SQL goals and adjust accordingly. This might involve:
- Changing time or resources allocated to specific channels or regions
- Revising marketing strategy entirely
- Using data and analytics to inform decisions

### 4. Celebrate Success

When SQL goals are reached, celebrate the achievement to maintain team motivation and focus on future targets.

## Summary Table

| Key Point | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Set clear SQL goals | Establish SMART goals for the number of SQLs to create |
| Break down goals by channel and region | Segment SQL goals to identify success areas and improvement opportunities |
| Track progress and make adjustments | Monitor performance against goals and adjust strategy based on data and analytics |
