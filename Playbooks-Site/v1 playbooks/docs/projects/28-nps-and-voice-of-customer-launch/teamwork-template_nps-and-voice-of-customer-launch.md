End state: Branded survey templates ready for deployment.<br /><br />• Customize NPS question wording if needed (standard: "How likely are you to recommend...")<br />• Add follow-up question for qualitative feedback ("What's the main reason for your score?")<br />• Configure conditional logic: different follow-ups for Promoters (9-10), Passives (7-8), Detractors (0-6)<br />• Apply client branding (logo, colors, fonts) to survey templates<br />• Keep survey short: 2-4 questions maximum for optimal response rates<br />• Test survey experience on desktop and mobile |
