| 1. Align Reporting Objectives with Growth Model | 2.5h | Meet with marketing leadership to define the specific questions the reporting pack must answer and align KPIs with the company's growth model targets. End state: Documented list of priority questions, KPIs, and target benchmarks.<br /><br />• Schedule kickoff meeting with VP Marketing and Marketing Ops stakeholders<br />• Review existing growth model to identify marketing-owned metrics (MQLs, pipeline contribution, CAC)<br />• Document the top 5-7 questions leadership needs answered monthly (e.g., "Are we hitting MQL targets?", "What's our channel mix?")<br />• Define primary KPIs: MQL volume, MQL-to-SQL conversion rate, pipeline velocity, cost per MQL, marketing-sourced pipeline<br />• Establish baseline benchmarks and target thresholds for red/yellow/green status indicators<br />• Get sign-off on reporting priorities before moving to data assessment |
| 2. Audit Current Data Sources and Gaps | 2.5h | Inventory all available data sources across MAP, CRM, and other platforms to identify what data exists, where it lives, and what gaps need addressing. End state: Data source inventory with gap analysis document.<br /><br />• List all marketing tech stack tools generating data (HubSpot/Marketo, Salesforce, Google Analytics, ad platforms)<br />• Document which metrics are available from each source and at what granularity<br />• Identify data gaps—metrics needed for reporting that don't currently exist or aren't tracked<br />• Assess data quality issues: missing UTM parameters, inconsistent naming conventions, duplicate records<br />• Map data refresh frequencies and determine if real-time vs. batch is required<br />• Document integration points between systems (API connections, native syncs, manual exports) |
| 3. Establish Metric Definitions and Ownership | 2h | Create shared definitions for all metrics to eliminate cross-team discrepancies and assign ownership for each KPI. End state: Metric glossary document with ownership assignments.<br /><br />• Define MQL criteria to match between MAP and CRM (prevent discrepancy issues between systems)<br />• Document funnel stage definitions (Lead → MQL → SQL → Opportunity → Closed Won)<br />• Create attribution model definitions (first-touch, last-touch, multi-touch rules)<br />• Assign a named owner to each primary metric who is accountable for data accuracy<br />• Align definitions with Sales/RevOps to ensure consistent reporting across teams<br />• Publish metric glossary in accessible location (wiki, shared drive) |
| 4. Design Reporting Template and Dashboard Prototype | 3h | Create the visual design and layout for the monthly reporting pack, balancing executive summary views with detailed drill-down capability. End state: Approved mockup/wireframe of the reporting pack structure.<br /><br />• Design executive summary page with top-level KPIs and red/yellow/green status indicators<br />• Plan funnel visualization showing conversion rates between stages<br />• Create channel performance section with spend, leads, and cost-per-lead by channel<br />• Design campaign performance view for tracking individual campaign ROI<br />• Include pipeline contribution section showing marketing-sourced vs. influenced pipeline<br />• Build in trend lines to show month-over-month and year-over-year comparisons<br />• Review prototype with stakeholders and incorporate feedback before building |
| 5. Build Data Pipeline and Connections | 4h | Establish the technical infrastructure to pull data from source systems into the reporting tool automatically. End state: Automated data pipeline refreshing on schedule without manual intervention.<br /><br />• Determine reporting tool (native CRM dashboards, BI tool like Tableau/Looker, or GTM system like Vasco)<br />• Connect primary data sources via native integrations or API<br />• Build data transformations to harmonize metrics across platforms (consistent naming, date formats)<br />• Configure refresh schedules (daily recommended for pipeline data, weekly acceptable for campaign metrics)<br />• Set up error alerting for failed data syncs or connection issues<br />• Test data accuracy by comparing dashboard output to source system spot-checks |
| 6. Build Core Dashboard Components | 4h | Construct the actual dashboard views and reports in the selected reporting tool. End state: Functional dashboard with all planned components populated with live data.<br /><br />• Build MQL and lead volume tracking with source breakdowns<br />• Create funnel conversion rate visualizations (Lead → MQL → SQL → Opp → Closed)<br />• Construct channel performance tables with spend, leads, CPL, and pipeline contribution<br />• Add campaign-level performance reports with ROI calculations<br />• Build pipeline velocity metrics (average time between stages)<br />• Create forecast vs. actual comparison views tied to growth model targets<br />• Add filters for date range, segment, region, and other relevant dimensions |
