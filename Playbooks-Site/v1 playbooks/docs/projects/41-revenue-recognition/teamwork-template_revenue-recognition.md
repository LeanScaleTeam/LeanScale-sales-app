**Hours:** 32h

### Task List: (Revenue Recognition) 1. Assessment & Configuration
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Audit Current Revenue Tracking Practices | 5h | Document how revenue metrics are currently being tracked across CRM, spreadsheets, and accounting systems to establish baseline and identify gaps. End state: Current state assessment showing what exists, what's missing, and where inconsistencies occur.<br /><br />• Interview Finance Controller and VP of Finance to document current revenue recognition policies and pain points<br />• Pull existing CRM opportunity field list and identify which revenue metrics exist vs. are missing (ARR, ACV, TCV, Net New ARR, Contract ARR, Net ARR)<br />• Review sample of 10-15 closed-won deals to identify inconsistencies in how revenue is being recorded<br />• Document all spreadsheets and manual calculations currently used for revenue reporting<br />• Map current quote-to-cash process flow from opportunity creation through invoice generation |

End state: Clear integration map showing CRM, billing, and accounting system connections and data dependencies.<br /><br />• Identify all systems in quote-to-cash process (CRM, CPQ, billing, accounting/ERP)<br />• Document integration points between CRM and billing system (e.g., Salesforce to Stripe/Chargebee)<br />• Map data flow from CRM to accounting software (e.g., Salesforce to QuickBooks/NetSuite/Xero)<br />• Identify which system is current source of truth for each revenue metric<br />• Document any API connections, sync schedules, and data transformation logic |
| 3. Define Revenue Metric Specifications | 6h | Align Finance and Sales on exact definitions and calculation logic for each revenue metric before building. End state: Written metric definitions document signed off by VP Finance, Controller, and VP Sales.<br /><br />• Define ARR calculation logic (include/exclude one-time fees, how to handle multi-year deals)<br />• Define ACV calculation (annual contract value including any one-time components)<br />• Define TCV calculation (total contract value across full term)<br />• Define Net New ARR (new logo ARR + expansion ARR - contraction ARR - churn ARR)<br />• Define Contract ARR (ARR at time of contract signature vs. start date)<br />• Document handling rules for edge cases: usage-based pricing, ramped deals, mid-term upgrades/downgrades<br />• Get explicit written sign-off from Finance and Sales leadership on all definitions |
| 4. Build Core Revenue Metric Fields | 6h | Create the primary revenue tracking fields in the CRM with formula calculations that auto-compute based on opportunity data. End state: Six core revenue fields created and calculating correctly on opportunity records.<br /><br />• Create ARR field with formula based on subscription amount and contract term<br />• Create ACV field with formula including subscription + one-time fees (per definition)<br />• Create TCV field with formula calculating total value across contract term<br />• Create Net New ARR field (may require rollup or flow logic for expansion/contraction tracking)<br />• Create Contract ARR field capturing ARR at booking moment<br />• Create Monthly Recognized Revenue field for deferred revenue tracking<br />• Test all formula calculations against 5 sample opportunities with known correct values |
| 5. Build Supporting Fields for Revenue Tracking | 5h | Create the secondary fields needed to support revenue calculations and handle various deal structures. End state: Complete field set supporting all revenue scenarios the client encounters.<br /><br />• Create Contract Start Date and Contract End Date fields (if not existing)<br />• Create Contract Term (Months) field with formula calculating term length<br />• Create Revenue Type picklist (New, Expansion, Renewal, Contraction, Churn)<br />• Create One-Time Fees field to separate from recurring revenue<br />• Create Usage/Variable Revenue field for variable pricing components<br />• Create Billing Frequency field (Monthly, Quarterly, Annual, Upfront)<br />• Document field dependencies and calculation order |
| 6. Configure Validation Rules & Data Quality Controls | 5h | Implement validation rules that prevent deals from closing without complete revenue data. End state: Validation rules active ensuring data integrity at deal close.<br /><br />• Create validation rule requiring Contract Start Date before marking Closed Won<br />• Create validation rule requiring Contract Term (Months) with minimum/maximum bounds<br />• Create validation rule requiring Revenue Type selection at Closed Won<br />• Add error messages explaining what's missing and how to fix it<br />• Configure validation rule exceptions for edge case handling (documented)<br />• Test validation rules by attempting to close opportunities with missing data |
