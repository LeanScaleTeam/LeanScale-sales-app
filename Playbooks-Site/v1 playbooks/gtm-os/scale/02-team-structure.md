## GTM Team Structure

**The model at Scale stage: functional leaders + teams + AI augmentation**

This is when the org chart starts looking like a real company. Individual contributors report to managers who report to directors or VPs. Functions have dedicated leadership. The founder is no longer managing every GTM person directly.

## Key Structural Shifts

| Shift | From (Stabilize) | To (Scale) |
|-------|------------------|------------|
| **Sales leadership** | Founder as player-coach | VP/Director of Sales with team |
| **Marketing** | Solo marketer or founder | Marketing leader with small team |
| **CS** | CSM or two | CS leader with coverage model |
| **RevOps** | Part-time or shared | Dedicated RevOps hire |
| **Enablement** | Ad-hoc, founder-led | First enablement function (often under RevOps) |

## Team Composition

| Function | Typical Roles | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Sales** | VP/Director, AEs (5-10), SDRs (2-5), possibly Sales Manager | First time having managers who aren't founders |
| **Marketing** | Director/VP, Demand Gen, Content, potentially PMM | Marketing ops often shared with RevOps |
| **Customer Success** | CS Leader, CSMs (3-8), potentially Support lead | Coverage model emerges (CSM:customer ratio) |
| **RevOps** | RevOps Manager or Director | Owns data, process, tools, reporting — critical hire |
| **Enablement** | Often under RevOps initially | Content creation, onboarding, ongoing training |

## AI Agent Integration at Scale

| Function | Automated Agents | Work Agents |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Sales** | Lead routing, activity logging, renewal alerts | Deal analysis, competitive positioning, forecast prep |
| **Marketing** | Campaign reporting, lead scoring updates, content distribution | Campaign strategy, messaging iteration, ABM account research |
| **CS** | Health score updates, renewal reminders, usage alerts | QBR prep, expansion identification, churn risk analysis |
| **RevOps** | Data hygiene, report generation, dashboard updates | Process design, territory modeling, tech stack evaluation |

## Hiring Decisions at Scale

| Signal | Hire | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Sales leader spending >50% on deals, not team | Sales Manager | Free up leadership for strategy and coaching |
| Marketing can't keep up with content demand | Content person or agency | Don't let content become blocker |
| CSMs reactive, no proactive engagement | Additional CSMs or CS Manager | Coverage model matters now |
| Nobody owns the data | RevOps (if not already) | This is often the highest-leverage hire |
| Reps take 6+ months to ramp | Enablement focus | Content, process, coaching infrastructure |
| >$2M in renewals managed manually | Renewal Manager or CS Ops | Process before it's a fire |

## Common Mistakes

- **Hiring AEs before solving pipeline** — more reps with bad pipeline = more failure
- **Skipping RevOps** — "we'll figure it out" becomes data chaos
- **Promoting top rep to manager** — sales skills ≠ management skills
- **No enablement investment** — expecting osmosis to work at scale
- **Founder staying in deals** — can't scale, creates dependency
