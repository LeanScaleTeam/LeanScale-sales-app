## Graduation Readiness

These are the signs that it's time to graduate from Scale stage:

- [ ] Team is built — functional leaders in place, not hiring for basics
- [ ] Process exists — documented, followed, measured (even if imperfect)
- [ ] Data is trustworthy — leadership makes decisions from dashboards, not anecdotes
- [ ] Forecasting is reliable — commits are within 10-15% of actuals
- [ ] Pipeline is predictable — consistent production, understood conversion
- [ ] Revenue approaching $15M ARR
- [ ] Ready to specialize by segment — different motions for different customers
- [ ] Efficiency matters more than just growth

## What Breaks If Too Early

- Trying to optimize systems that don't exist yet
- Segmenting before understanding segments
- Efficiency focus without scale foundation
- Specialization that fragments rather than focuses

## What Breaks If Too Late

- Scaling inefficiency — growing costs faster than revenue
- Missing efficiency opportunities while competitors capitalize
- Process debt compounds — harder to fix later
- Team frustration — high performers want growth
