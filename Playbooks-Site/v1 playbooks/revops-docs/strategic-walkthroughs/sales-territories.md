# Building Sales Territories

Creating fair sales territories is crucial for ensuring equal opportunities for success among your sales team. The foundation of this process lies in accurately valuing your total addressable market (TAM) by account.

## Step 1: Define Your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

The ICP is a fundamental framework that helps you identify your best-fit customers. It considers various factors such as industry, company size, revenue, and technology stack.

By clearly defining your ICP, you gain a deep understanding of who you are selling to, the problems they face, and their propensity to purchase your offerings.

## Step 2: Identify Data Sources for ICP-Matching

Once your ICP is established, the next step is to gather data from reliable sources to identify companies and individuals that align with your ideal customer profile.

This step involves mapping out the number of potential customers, their locations, and their potential value to your business.

## Step 3: Create a Valuation Methodology for Accounts

This step is the most intricate and judgment-based part of the process. Developing a valuation methodology for accounts requires a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors.

You can leverage various frameworks to assist in this process, but ultimately, you must tailor your methodology to align with your specific business goals and offerings.

## Step 4: Value Your Territories

With your valuation methodology in place, you can now assign values to your territories. This involves analyzing the data collected in the previous steps to determine the potential revenue and growth opportunities associated with each territory.

## Step 5: Assign Territories to Your Sales Team

Based on the valuations, you can now fairly and equitably assign territories to your sales team. This ensures that each salesperson has an equal chance of success and contributes effectively to your overall sales objectives.

## Conclusion

By following these five steps, you can establish a data-driven and strategic approach to valuing your territories. This enables you to create fair sales territories, optimize your sales team's performance, and drive revenue growth for your business.
