### Task List: (GTM Reporting Pack) 1. Discovery & Data Consolidation
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Identify Audiences and Use Cases | 2h | Map all stakeholders who will consume the reporting pack and document their specific needs. End state: Clear audience matrix with use cases, detail levels, and frequency requirements.<br /><br />• Interview key stakeholders (CEO, CFO, VP Sales, VP Marketing, Board members if accessible)<br />• Document primary use cases: MBRs, QBRs, board meetings, investor updates, all-hands<br />• Identify detail level requirements per audience (executive summary vs. operational drill-down)<br />• Determine delivery frequency and format preferences (slides, PDF, live dashboard)<br />• Capture any existing reporting pain points or trust issues with current data |
| 2. Audit Current Reporting State | 2h | Assess existing reports, data sources, and metric definitions across teams. End state: Gap analysis showing what exists vs. what's needed, plus data source inventory.<br /><br />• Collect all existing monthly/quarterly reports from each function (Sales, Marketing, CS, Finance)<br />• Document current metric definitions and identify inconsistencies across teams<br />• Inventory data sources: CRM, marketing automation, CS platform, finance systems<br />• Identify metrics that are manually calculated vs. automated<br />• Flag data quality issues, missing metrics, or definition conflicts between teams |
| 3. Define Metric Framework | 2h | Confirm the Power 10 GTM Metrics and operational KPIs to include with consistent definitions. End state: Approved metric list with standardized definitions, owners, and data sources.<br /><br />• Map Power 10 GTM Metrics to client's specific context and naming conventions<br />• Define operational KPIs for each function (Sales, Marketing, CS, Finance)<br />• Establish calculation methodology and data source for each metric<br />• Assign metric owners responsible for data accuracy<br />• Get stakeholder sign-off on metric definitions to prevent future disputes |
| 4. Map Data Sources to Metrics | 2h | Connect each approved metric to its authoritative data source and document extraction requirements. End state: Data architecture map showing metric → source → extraction method.<br /><br />• Create metric-to-source mapping document<br />• Identify primary vs. secondary data sources for each metric<br />• Document API access, export methods, or manual pull requirements<br />• Flag metrics requiring cross-system calculations (e.g., CAC needs marketing + sales data)<br />• Identify refresh frequency capabilities for each source |
| 5. Build Data Extraction Process | 2.5h | Establish repeatable process for pulling data from all sources on a scheduled basis. End state: Documented extraction workflow with automation where possible.<br /><br />• Set up scheduled exports or API pulls from primary systems<br />• Create data staging area (spreadsheet or lightweight database)<br />• Build validation checks to catch data anomalies (nulls, duplicates, outliers)<br />• Document manual steps required and time estimates<br />• Test full extraction cycle and document any issues |
| 6. Validate Historical Data | 2.5h | Pull and verify 3-6 months of historical data to establish baselines and validate accuracy. End state: Verified historical dataset ready for trend analysis.<br /><br />• Extract historical data for all approved metrics (minimum 3 months, ideally 6-12)<br />• Cross-reference against known benchmarks (previous board decks, finance actuals)<br />• Reconcile discrepancies between sources<br />• Document any data gaps or periods with unreliable data<br />• Get stakeholder validation that historical numbers are accurate |

### Task List: (GTM Reporting Pack) 2. Deck Build & Enablement
**Contains:** Parts 3-4

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 7. Design Deck Structure and Layout | 2h | Create the logical flow and visual framework for the reporting pack. End state: Approved deck skeleton with section headers, slide types, and navigation.<br /><br />• Define deck sections: Executive Summary, Power 10 Metrics, Function Deep-Dives, Appendix<br />• Design slide templates for different content types (scorecards, trends, commentary)<br />• Establish visual hierarchy: what metrics get prominence vs. supporting detail<br />• Create consistent color coding for performance indicators (green/yellow/red)<br />• Build navigation system for longer decks (table of contents, section dividers) |
| 8. Build Executive Summary Section | 2.5h | Create the high-impact opening section that tells the business story at a glance. End state: 3-5 slide executive summary with key takeaways and Power 10 metrics.<br /><br />• Design one-page business health scorecard with Power 10 metrics<br />• Create trend visualization showing month-over-month or quarter-over-quarter changes<br />• Build "Top 3 Wins / Top 3 Concerns" commentary section<br />• Include forward-looking indicators (pipeline coverage, forecast vs. target)<br />• Ensure section can stand alone for time-constrained audiences |
| 9. Build Functional Deep-Dive Sections | 3.5h | Create detailed sections for each GTM function with operational KPIs. End state: Dedicated section per function with relevant metrics and insights.<br /><br />• Build Sales section: pipeline metrics, conversion rates, rep productivity, forecast accuracy<br />• Build Marketing section: funnel metrics, channel performance, CAC components, attribution<br />• Build Customer Success section: retention, expansion, NPS/health scores, churn drivers<br />• Build Finance/ARR section: revenue actuals, cohort analysis, unit economics<br />• Ensure consistent formatting across all functional sections |
| 10. Create Appendix and Data Documentation | 1.5h | Build supporting materials for drill-down questions and methodology transparency. End state: Appendix with detailed data, definitions, and methodology notes.<br /><br />• Create metric definition glossary with calculation formulas<br />• Build detailed data tables for those who want to see raw numbers<br />• Document data sources and refresh dates<br />• Include methodology notes for complex calculations (attribution, CAC, LTV)<br />• Add contact information for metric owners/questions |
| 11. Create Update Runbook | 1.5h | Document the step-by-step process for updating the reporting pack each period. End state: Written SOP that internal team can follow independently.<br /><br />• Document data extraction steps with screenshots and timing<br />• Create update checklist covering each section of the deck<br />• Specify review and approval workflow before distribution<br />• Include troubleshooting guide for common data issues<br />• Establish timeline: when to start, when to complete, when to distribute |
| 12. Train Internal Team | 2h | Enable client team to own ongoing updates and maintenance. End state: Team trained and confident in updating the pack independently.<br /><br />• Schedule training session (60-90 min) with designated report owners<br />• Walk through full update cycle using the runbook<br />• Cover common data issues and how to resolve them<br />• Practice making updates with team observing<br />• Record session for future reference and new team member onboarding |
| 13. Conduct First Live Cycle | 2h | Support the first independent update cycle to ensure smooth handoff.
