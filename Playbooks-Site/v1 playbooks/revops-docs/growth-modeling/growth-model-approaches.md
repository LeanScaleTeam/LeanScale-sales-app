# Growth Model Approaches

There are three primary planning methodologies for startup growth modeling. The best choice for a particular startup will depend on its specific circumstances.

## 1. Top-Down Planning

Top-down planning begins with executive leadership establishing high-level strategic targets. Goals flow from leadership to functional teams.

### Advantages
- Provides clear direction for the organization
- Ensures alignment across all teams
- Facilitates resource allocation decisions

### Disadvantages
- Can lack flexibility to respond to market changes
- May ignore valuable team insights
- Risks reducing team ownership and buy-in

## 2. Bottom-Up Planning

Bottom-up planning starts with functional teams analyzing historical data to identify growth opportunities. Teams develop detailed plans that consolidate into company-wide strategy.

### Advantages
- Leverages team expertise and ground-level insights
- Grounded in realistic data and achievable targets
- Builds team buy-in and ownership

### Disadvantages
- Time-intensive coordination across teams
- Potential misalignment with overall strategy
- May lack standardization across departments

## 3. The W Method

The W method combines both approaches through iterative cycles. Leadership provides top-down guidance, while teams develop bottom-up plans with feedback loops between levels.

### Advantages
- Merges benefits of both approaches
- Maintains strategic direction while enabling team expertise
- Adaptable to changing market conditions

### Disadvantages
- Requires significant time investment
- Demands strong cross-team collaboration
- More complex to manage and coordinate

## Choosing Your Approach

Select your planning methodology based on startup needs:

| Situation | Recommended Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Need strong direction and alignment | Top-Down |
| Want to leverage team expertise | Bottom-Up |
| Seeking balanced benefits | W Method |
