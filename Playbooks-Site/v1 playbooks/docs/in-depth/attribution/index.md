## Key Concepts

- **Multi-Touch Attribution:** Assigns credit to multiple touchpoints across the buyer journey, not just first or last touch
- **UTM Taxonomy:** Standardized tracking parameters for campaign URLs
- **Campaign Influence:** CRM feature that links campaigns to opportunities and allocates revenue credit
- **Attribution Lookback Window:** Time period to consider when connecting touchpoints to conversions (e.g., 90 days)

## When to Use This Project

**Good fit:**
- Marketing cannot prove ROI on campaigns
- Touchpoint data is siloed across CRM, marketing automation, and web analytics
- Leadership asks "which campaigns are working?" and marketing can only point to vanity metrics
- Sales and marketing finger-point about lead quality with no shared view of buyer journey

**Prerequisites:**
- Marketing automation platform (HubSpot, Marketo) connected to CRM
- CRM with campaign object or equivalent
- Web analytics with conversion tracking
- Minimum 6 months of historical lead/opportunity data

**Related Projects:**
- Lead Lifecycle Definition (defines stages that attribution tracks)
- Marketing Operations (upstream form and tracking infrastructure)
- Revenue Intelligence (downstream reporting and insights)
