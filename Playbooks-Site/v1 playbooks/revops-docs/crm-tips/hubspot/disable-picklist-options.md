## Overview

This guide shows you how to disable picklist options in HubSpot without deleting them, allowing you to maintain historical data while preventing users from selecting outdated options.

## Why Disable Instead of Delete?

- **Preserve historical data**: Records with the old value remain intact
- **Maintain reporting accuracy**: Historical reports still show correct values
- **Audit trail**: You can see what values were previously used

## Steps to Disable Picklist Options

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Properties**
2. Find and select the property you want to modify
3. Click on the picklist option you want to disable
4. Toggle the option to disabled/inactive
5. Save your changes

The disabled option will no longer appear in dropdown menus but will still display on existing records.
