# Building a Growth Model

Growth modeling is the key to building your plan to hit your targets each year. Poor planning is the #1 mistake companies make regardless of their stage.

## Key Inputs

The model requires foundational company data:

- **Current ARR** (annual recurring revenue)
- **Growth targets**
- **SQL to close conversion rates**
- **Sales cycle length** (in days)
- **SQL to MQL conversion rates**
- **Pipeline to SQL conversion metrics**
- **Customer success carry ratios**

## Key Outputs

The framework generates high-level goals including:

- Total bookings projections
- Required MQLs and created pipeline volumes
- Logo growth targets
- CSM staffing requirements

## Three Planning Approaches

### Bottom-Up Sales Capacity Plan

Calculates per-rep productivity and required headcount using the formula:

```
Number of Reps = Total Bookings / (Rep Productivity x Sales Cycle)
```

See [Sales Capacity Plan](/revops-docs/growth-modeling/sales-capacity-plan) for detailed guidance.

### Bottom-Up Created Pipeline Plan

Determines pipeline needs and funding-to-production ratios through conversion rate analysis.

See [Marketing Plan](/revops-docs/growth-modeling/marketing-plan) for detailed guidance.

### Customer Success Carry Plan

Forecasts customer bookings, new logos, and CSM requirements based on conversion and carry ratios.

See [Customer Success Plan](/revops-docs/growth-modeling/customer-success-plan) for detailed guidance.
