### Task List: (Event Lead Intake) 1. Discovery, Automation & Tracking
**Contains:** Parts 1-3

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Audit Current Event Lead Intake Process | 2h | Document how event leads currently flow from capture to CRM, identifying manual steps, bottlenecks, and data quality gaps. End state: Current state process map with pain points identified.<br /><br />• Interview event marketing team on current list collection methods (badge scans, manual forms, third-party apps)<br />• Review last 3-5 event list imports to identify common data issues (missing fields, duplicates, formatting)<br />• Map current workflow from lead capture to CRM entry to sales assignment<br />• Document average time from event to lead availability in CRM (typical pain point: 3-7+ days)<br />• Identify which systems touch event leads (event platforms, spreadsheets, MAP, CRM) |
| 2. Define Event Lead Data Requirements | 2h | Establish the required and optional data fields for event leads, aligned with CRM/MAP data model. End state: Documented field mapping template for all event lead sources.<br /><br />• Define required fields: First Name, Last Name, Email, Company, Lead Source, Event Name, Campaign ID<br />• Define optional enrichment fields: Title, Phone, Industry, Company Size, Booth Interaction Notes<br />• Create field mapping document that translates event platform fields to CRM/MAP fields<br />• Establish data validation rules (email format, required fields, picklist values)<br />• Confirm compliance requirements for GDPR/CCPA consent capture at events |
| 3. Define Lead Source Categories and Campaign Hierarchy | 1.5h | Create standardized lead source values and campaign structure for event leads to enable accurate attribution. End state: Lead source taxonomy and campaign naming convention documented.<br /><br />• Define lead source picklist values (Trade Show, Webinar, Conference, Roadshow, Virtual Event)<br />• Create sub-source categories (Booth Visit, Session Attendance, Demo Request, Badge Scan)<br />• Establish campaign naming convention (e.g., EVT-2024-Dreamforce-Booth)<br />• Map event types to existing campaign hierarchy in MAP/CRM<br />• Document how event leads connect to parent campaigns for rollup reporting |
| 4. Configure List Import Templates and Validation | 2h | Build standardized import templates with built-in validation to ensure data quality before records enter the system. End state: Reusable import templates with validation rules active.<br /><br />• Create CSV/Excel import templates with required columns and formatting guidelines<br />• Build data validation rules in MAP (email format, required fields, duplicate checking)<br />• Configure field mapping for common event platforms (Eventbrite, Cvent, Splash, ON24)<br />• Set up pre-import deduplication logic (match on email, then company+name)<br />• Test import template with sample data to verify field mapping accuracy |
| 5. Build Automated Lead Processing Workflows | 2.5h | Create automation workflows that process incoming event leads through standardization, enrichment, and routing. End state: Automated workflows triggered on event lead creation.<br /><br />• Build lead processing workflow triggered by Lead Source = Event types<br />• Configure data standardization steps (company name normalization, title standardization)<br />• Set up automated field population (region based on country, segment based on company size)<br />• Create duplicate handling rules (update existing vs. create new with merge flag)<br />• Configure lead status assignment based on data completeness and engagement signals |
| 6. Configure Lead Assignment Rules for Event Leads | 2h | Set up routing rules that assign event leads to appropriate sales reps or nurture tracks based on qualification criteria. End state: Event leads automatically routed within 24 hours of import.<br /><br />• Define assignment criteria (territory, company size, existing account ownership)<br />• Configure round-robin assignment for unowned/new accounts<br />• Set up hot lead alerts for high-priority event interactions (demo requests, pricing discussions)<br />• Build fallback assignment rules for edge cases (no territory match, existing customer)<br />• Test assignment logic with sample leads across all scenarios |
| 7. Build Event Lead Tracking Mechanisms | 2h | Implement tracking to monitor lead flow from event capture through sales follow-up. End state: Lead lifecycle tracking active with stage timestamps.<br /><br />• Configure lead status fields to track intake stages (New, Processing, Assigned, Contacted, Qualified)<br />• Set up timestamp fields for key milestones (Import Date, Assignment Date, First Touch Date)<br />• Create activity tracking for sales follow-up (calls, emails, meetings) linked to event source<br />• Configure sync between MAP engagement data and CRM for unified view<br />• Test tracking across full lead lifecycle with sample event leads |
| 8. Create Event Lead Performance Reports and Dashboards | 2.5h | Build reports and dashboards showing event lead intake performance, conversion metrics, and ROI indicators. End state: Executive dashboard and operational reports published.<br /><br />• Build lead intake report: volume by event, source breakdown, import SLA compliance<br />• Create conversion funnel report: Event Lead to MQL to SQL to Opportunity by event<br />• Build speed-to-lead report: time from import to first sales touch by event/rep<br />• Create data quality scorecard: duplicate rate, field completeness, invalid records<br />• Assemble executive dashboard with event ROI summary and trend analysis |

### Task List: (Event Lead Intake) 2. Testing, Training & Launch
**Contains:** Parts 4-6

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 9. Conduct End-to-End Process Testing | 2h | Test the complete intake process with sample data to validate all automations, integrations, and routing work correctly. End state: Process validated with documented test results.<br /><br />• Create test lead list mimicking real event data (various sources, data quality levels)<br />• Execute full import process and verify field mapping accuracy<br />• Validate deduplication logic handles existing records correctly<br />• Confirm assignment rules route leads to correct owners<br />• Verify all tracking fields populate with accurate timestamps |
| 10. Perform User Acceptance Testing with Stakeholders | 1.5h | Have event marketing and sales stakeholders validate the process meets their needs before launch. End state: Sign-off from Event Marketing and Sales on process readiness.<br /><br />• Walk event marketing team through import template and process<br />• Have sales team validate lead assignment and alert notifications<br />• Review reports with marketing ops to confirm attribution accuracy<br />• Document any issues or change requests from UAT<br />• Get formal approval to proceed with production launch |
