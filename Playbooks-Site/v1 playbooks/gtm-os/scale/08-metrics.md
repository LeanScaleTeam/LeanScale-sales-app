## Metrics to Measure

**Principle:** Measure what matters for scaling — pipeline predictability, forecasting accuracy, and efficiency. Data maturity increases; more metrics become reliable.

## Core Metrics at Scale

| Metric | Why It Matters | Target |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **ARR/MRR** | Business health | Growth rate matters more than absolute |
| **Pipeline production** | Future revenue | 3-4x coverage minimum |
| **Pipeline conversion** | Funnel efficiency | Track stage-to-stage |
| **Forecast accuracy** | Predictability | Within 10% of commit |
| **Sales cycle length** | Efficiency | Trend and segment split |
| **Win rate** | Effectiveness | By segment, source, rep |
| **CAC** | Acquisition efficiency | By channel, segment |
| **GRR** | Base retention | >85-90% |
| **NRR** | Growth from customers | >100-110% |

## What's New at Scale (vs. Stabilize)

| Metric | Why It Emerges |
|--------|---------------|
| **Forecast accuracy** | Enough pipeline to forecast meaningfully |
| **Pipeline coverage ratio** | Team size requires coverage discipline |
| **Rep productivity** | Multiple reps need benchmarking |
| **Marketing-sourced %** | Marketing now accountable for pipeline |
| **Sales cycle by segment** | Segmentation makes this meaningful |
| **CAC payback** | Efficiency matters with scale investment |

## Metrics by Function

**Sales:**

| Metric | What to Track |
|--------|--------------|
| Pipeline production | By rep, segment, source |
| Pipeline velocity | Dollar × conversion ÷ cycle time |
| Forecast vs. actual | Weekly/monthly accuracy |
| Rep attainment | % of quota, trend |
| Activity metrics | Leading indicators |

**Marketing:**

| Metric | What to Track |
|--------|--------------|
| MQL production | Volume and trend |
| MQL→SQL conversion | Lead quality |
| Marketing-sourced pipeline | Attribution |
| CAC by channel | Efficiency |
| Content performance | Engagement, conversion |

**Customer Success:**

| Metric | What to Track |
|--------|--------------|
| GRR and NRR | Retention health |
| Health score distribution | Portfolio health |
| Onboarding completion | Time to value |
| Expansion pipeline | Growth opportunity |
| Support metrics | CSAT, response time |

## What NOT to Measure Yet

- **LTV:CAC ratio** — requires mature cohort data (Optimize stage metric)
- **Magic number** — requires consistent quarters of data
- **Segment-level unit economics** — wait until segments are stable

**Series B benchmark ranges (from LeanScale Growth Model):**

| Metric | Strategic (Ent) | Commercial |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| **ACV** | $300K | $50K |
| **SQL→CW Conversion** | 5% | 6% |
| **Sales Cycle** | 2 quarters | 1 quarter |
| **Quota/Rep** | $1.2M | $800K |
| **CSM Capacity** | $4M ARR | $2M ARR |
| **Net Retention** | 105% | 105% |
| **Cost per SQL** | $5,000 | $5,000 |

*Note: Series B typically $15-45M ARR, with Enterprise + Commercial segments.*
