# About LeanScale

## Overview

LeanScale is a revenue operations consulting firm partnering with venture capital portfolio companies to build world-class RevOps capabilities. The organization describes itself as invested in the growth journey of its clients rather than operating as traditional consultants or contractors.

## Mission and Approach

The company is "passionate about attracting the best startup talent and taking a team approach to developing the most comprehensive RevOps capabilities." LeanScale works with rapidly expanding VC-backed startups, including companies like Mistral AI, Chainguard, Clio, and AssemblyAI.

## RevOps Docs Initiative

LeanScale provides free documentation and educational resources through RevOps Docs for Startups. The team explains: "RevOps Docs are a way for us to give our insight into startups to everyone for free." The goal is to help early-stage companies approach their go-to-market strategies thoughtfully, ensuring that infrastructure limitations don't hinder their ability to achieve ambitious growth targets.

## Core Philosophy

The organization emphasizes helping startups develop mature revenue operations practices despite their resource constraints, recognizing that thoughtful GTM planning can compensate for operational immaturity in early-stage businesses.
