## Overview

This page features an interview and product demonstration with Christina Brady, co-founder and CEO of Luster, a diagnostic-driven sales enablement platform designed for go-to-market teams.

## Key Topics Discussed

### Platform Purpose

Luster addresses the gap between identifying skill gaps and enabling reps to close them. The platform emphasizes a three-step approach: diagnose, predict, and prescribe tailored practice.

### Core Value Proposition

- **Diagnosis**: Maps skills at granular levels across sales stages per individual
- **Prediction**: Forecasts revenue impact within 24-48 hours
- **Prescription**: Generates customized practice sessions and dress rehearsals

### Technical Architecture

The platform uses a customer-specific, closed instance approach rather than a shared LLM wrapper. This enables:

- SOC 2 compliance and security hardening
- LLM flexibility (not locked into single provider)
- Custom model training per customer
- Natural conversation latency matching user behavior

### Practice Modes

Two learning approaches based on cognitive psychology:

1. **Full call simulations** mimicking real customer interactions
2. **Skill drills** targeting specific objections with AI coaching

### Data Integration

Integrations with Zoom and Teams enable:

- Automatic proficiency mapping from prior calls
- Post-call scoring against training standards
- Calendar-based interaction analysis
- Proactive practice scheduling

### Manager and Enablement Features

- Weekly customized coaching reports highlighting proficiency gaps
- Proactive call tagging for manager involvement
- Scalable learning journeys reducing management bottlenecks

### Hiring and Onboarding

The platform can:

- Assess candidate skills pre-hire
- Create prescriptive onboarding paths
- Reduce ramp times significantly
- Provide objective proficiency measurements

## Key Quotes

"We make our customers collateral damage to our inability to properly measure team competency" - reflects the founding motivation behind addressing skill gaps before revenue impact.

"Diagnosis was missing; enablement alone often failed" - emphasizes the two-step diagnostic-first methodology.

"Move responsibly" - describes the deliberate platform approach prioritizing stability over rapid feature deployment.

## Business Model Highlights

- Focus on enterprise-grade security and reliability
- Flexible purchasing options (pilots, yearly commitments)
- Confident in product performance through testing opportunities
