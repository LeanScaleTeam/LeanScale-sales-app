# Lead Source Taxonomy

This guide provides a framework for organizing lead sources into a structured taxonomy to understand marketing and sales performance.

## Three-Level Taxonomy Structure

The framework organizes lead sources hierarchically:

### Level 1: Lead Source Grouping

Broad categories aligned with business functions:
- Sales
- Marketing
- Customer Success
- Referrals

### Level 2: Lead Source

Specific sources tied to budgets:
- Events
- Paid advertising
- SDR outreach

### Level 3: Lead Source Details

Granular channels and campaigns:
- Trade shows
- Customer events
- Prospect events

## Audience Levels

Different stakeholders need different levels of granularity:

### Executives

Benefit from high-level views showing whether leads come from:
- Marketing
- Sales
- Product-led growth strategies

### Functional Leaders

Need mid-tier granularity to:
- Understand specific channels
- Adjust marketing budgets accordingly

### Marketing Operations

Require the most detailed taxonomy to:
- Scrutinize the performance of individual channels
- Refine strategies based on funnel metrics

## Core Principles

Two foundational requirements ensure an effective taxonomy:

### Mutually Exclusive

Each source is distinct and unambiguous. A lead should only fit into one category at each level.

### Comprehensively Exhaustive

Every lead has a specific place in the structure. No lead should fall outside the taxonomy.
