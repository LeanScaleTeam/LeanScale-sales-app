## Key Investment Framework: Wave, Surfer, Surfboard

Sophie employs a metaphorical approach to evaluate startups. The "wave" represents macro trends (AI, infrastructure costs, regulatory shifts), the "surfer" embodies the founder's vision and execution capability, and the "surfboard" is the product. Early-stage success hinges on aligning team with timing.

## Founder Evaluation Signals

### Earned Secrets

Founders possessing deep, non-obvious insights into problem spaces demonstrate competitive advantage. This stems from lived experience—having built related solutions previously—or obsessive problem exploration. Sophie highlights founder Mark Andre, who built an ISP before creating software to operate it.

### Key Founder Traits

- **High agency and relentless execution**
- **Outstanding references and back-channel signals**
- **"Spikiness"—exceptional expertise in one domain** rather than well-rounded generalists
- **Unfair advantage in execution** particularly as technological moats decline

## Product Traction Signals

Revenue alone isn't predictive. Instead, Sophie prioritizes:

- Deep customer engagement over numerous loose logos
- Enterprise validation and founder-led sales
- Usage depth, retention, and rapid shipping velocity
- "Quality of traction matters more than raw numbers" at seed stage

## GTM Execution Matters Most

Engineering no longer represents the primary bottleneck. "Go-to-market strategy and execution determines whether you win," Sophie emphasizes, particularly as AI commoditizes product development.

## Red Flags in Due Diligence

- **Disorganized fundraising process** signals poor execution discipline
- **Negative back-channel references** carry significant weight early-stage
- **Bridge burning** in the venture ecosystem damages credibility
- **Artificial urgency** (false closing deadlines) indicates dishonesty
- **Poor chemistry** undermines long-term partnership viability

## Sophie's Personal Framework

Sophie structures her career around three anchors: innovation, education, and community—reflected through GTM Fund's portfolio support, GTM Now media platform, and a 350+ SaaS leader network.
