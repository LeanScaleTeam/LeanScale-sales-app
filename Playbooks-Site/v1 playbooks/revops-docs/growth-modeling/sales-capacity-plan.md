# Sales Capacity Plan

Learn how to build an effective sales capacity plan to hit your revenue targets.

Sales capacity planning determines how many sales representatives and resources are needed to achieve revenue goals. This guide provides a structured approach covering six main steps.

## 1. Setting Quotas and Attainment

Establish sales objectives and performance targets while considering:

- **Past performance** - Historical quota attainment rates
- **Market factors** - Competitive landscape and market conditions
- **Company goals** - Overall revenue and growth targets

### Key Metrics
- Individual rep quotas
- Team quotas
- Expected attainment percentages

## 2. Incorporating Ramp Time and Recruitment

Account for the duration new representatives need to reach full productivity:

- **Training period** - Initial onboarding and product knowledge
- **Pipeline development** - Time to build qualified opportunities
- **Full productivity** - Achieving consistent quota performance

Typical ramp periods range from 3-6 months depending on sales complexity.

## 3. Designing Territories

Divide markets into manageable geographic areas balanced by:

- **Workload** - Number of accounts and opportunities
- **Revenue potential** - Market size and growth opportunity
- **Coverage** - Ensuring adequate attention for all accounts

## 4. Calculating Capacity Needed

Determine headcount requirements by factoring in:

- **Quotas** - Total revenue targets
- **Ramp time** - New hire productivity curves
- **Attrition rates** - Expected turnover
- **Current team size** - Existing productive capacity

### Capacity Formula

```
Required Headcount = Target Revenue / (Quota x Expected Attainment x Productive Months)
```

## 5. Determining Pipeline Needed

Estimate qualified leads required based on:

- **Sales cycle length** - Time from opportunity to close
- **Win rates** - Historical close percentages
- **Lead generation per representative** - Expected pipeline creation

### Pipeline Coverage Formula

```
Required Pipeline = Target Revenue / Win Rate
```

Most companies target 3-4x pipeline coverage.

## 6. Developing Commission Plans

Create compensation structures including:

- **Base salaries** - Fixed compensation component
- **Commissions** - Variable pay tied to performance
- **Bonuses** - Additional incentives for exceeding targets

Consider company philosophy and budget when designing pay structures.
