## AI Agent Recommendations

## Automated Agents (Headless)

What's new at Stabilize — you have reps to support now:

| Use Case | SOP/Playbook Required | Tool Example |
|----------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Lead enrichment** | Automated Inbound SOP | Clay + HubSpot workflow |
| **Lead routing** | Lead routing rules | HubSpot workflow, Chili Piper |
| **CRM data entry** | Transcript processing | Fireflies + Zapier → CRM |
| **Onboarding sequences** | Onboarding playbook | HubSpot sequences |
| **Renewal reminders** | Renewal process | CRM workflow triggers |
| **Rep activity capture** | Activity capture | Gong → CRM sync |

## Work Agents (Interactive)

AI agents now support the team, not just founder:

| Use Case | Who Uses It | Example Prompt |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Deal coaching** | AE/SDR | "Review this deal — what should I do next based on the call transcript?" |
| **Call review** | Manager | "Summarize this rep's last 5 calls and identify coaching opportunities" |
| **Competitive intel** | AE | "How should I position against [competitor] based on what we know?" |
| **Onboarding prep** | CSM | "Create an onboarding plan for this customer based on the handoff doc" |
| **QBR prep** | CSM | "Draft a QBR deck based on this customer's usage data and notes" |
| **Pipeline review** | Manager | "Analyze our pipeline and flag deals that look at risk" |

## What's New vs. Build Stage

- **Rep enablement** — AI helps train and support new hires
- **Manager leverage** — AI helps with coaching, review, analysis
- **Process automation** — More SOPs means more automation opportunities

## When AI Agents Hit Limits

- High-stakes negotiations (AE judgment required)
- Customer relationship decisions (CSM owns the relationship)
- Hiring and people decisions (human judgment)
- Strategic account planning (cross-functional input needed)
