## GTM Team Structure

**The model at Optimize stage: Specialized teams with efficiency focus**

The team is built. Functional leaders are in place. The question is no longer "do we have capacity?" — it's "are we deploying capacity efficiently?" This stage introduces specialization: segment-specific roles, dedicated ops functions, and AI agents handling efficiency plays at scale.

## Structural Shifts from Scale

| Dimension | Scale Stage | Optimize Stage |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Team philosophy** | Build the team | Deploy the team efficiently |
| **Role design** | General capability | Segment specialization |
| **Leadership** | Functional leaders hired | Functional leaders optimizing |
| **RevOps** | Building infrastructure | Optimizing infrastructure |
| **AI integration** | Agents supporting team | Agents driving efficiency |

## Team Composition

| Function | Human Roles | AI Agent Integration |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Sales** | Segment-specific AEs, SDR team with specialization, Sales Managers, Deal Desk | **Automated:** Pipeline analytics, territory optimization, comp calculation, forecast models. **Work:** Deal strategy, competitive positioning, segment analysis |
| **Marketing** | Demand Gen by segment, Content team, Marketing Ops, ABM (if enterprise) | **Automated:** Attribution modeling, spend optimization, content performance, campaign triggers. **Work:** Segment strategy, creative development, program design |
| **Customer Success** | CSMs by segment, Onboarding specialists, Renewal managers, possibly Account Managers | **Automated:** Health scoring, expansion triggers, renewal workflows, churn prediction. **Work:** Portfolio strategy, playbook optimization, escalation analysis |
| **RevOps** | Revenue Ops Manager/Director, Systems Admin, Data Analyst, possibly BI | **Automated:** Data quality, reporting automation, system maintenance, anomaly detection. **Work:** Process optimization, capacity modeling, tech stack analysis |
| **Partnerships** | Partner Manager, possibly Partner Ops | **Automated:** Partner performance tracking, co-marketing execution. **Work:** Partner strategy, program design, relationship management |

## Key Role Additions at Optimize

| Role | Why Now | Signs to Hire |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Deal Desk** | Pricing complexity requires governance | >50% of deals need custom approval |
| **Account Managers** | Dedicated expansion capacity | Expansion is significant revenue source, CSMs overloaded |
| **Marketing Ops** | MAP and attribution complexity | Marketing tech stack needs dedicated owner |
| **RevOps Director** | Cross-functional optimization | RevOps activities outgrow a single manager |
| **BI Analyst** | Insight beyond operational reporting | Leadership needs analysis, not just dashboards |
| **Enablement Manager** | Segment-specific training needs | Different segments require different training |

## Segment Specialization

At Optimize, segment specialization becomes structural, not just procedural:

| Segment | Typical Structure |
|---------|------------------|
| **Enterprise** | Dedicated AEs, named CSMs, 1:Few ABM, possibly Solution Engineers |
| **Mid-Market** | Segment-specific AEs, pooled CSMs by book, demand gen programs |
| **SMB** | Higher-velocity reps, digital CSM touch, self-serve expansion where possible |

## When to Specialize
- Clear segment differences in sales motion, ACV, and success requirements
- Data shows segment-specific conversion rates and unit economics
- Team size supports specialization without fragmentation

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Happens | Better Approach |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Over-specializing too fast** | Excitement about efficiency | Specialize where data shows clear ROI |
| **Hiring ahead of optimization** | Default to headcount | Optimize existing team before adding |
| **Ignoring AI efficiency gains** | Preference for humans | AI agents can handle many efficiency plays |
| **Fragmenting rather than focusing** | Too many segments | Start with 2-3 clear segments, not 5+ |
| **Cutting too deep** | Pressure from board | Efficiency gains take time to materialize |
