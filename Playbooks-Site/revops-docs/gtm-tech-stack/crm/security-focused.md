# Security-Focused CRM

CRM security is frequently overlooked by RevOps professionals and sales leaders. However, understanding and implementing security measures is vital to prevent data breaches and integrity issues that could harm business operations, budgets, and go-to-market capabilities.

## Challenges of CRM Security

Implementing robust security measures can complicate user experience, as it may require complex login processes and data restrictions. Organizations must balance protective measures with maintaining user productivity for individual contributors.

## Security Recommendations

### 1. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Enable 2FA for all users to add an extra security layer and prevent unauthorized CRM access.

### 2. Regular Database Backups

Perform consistent backups and store them securely to preserve historical data and protect against breaches or corruption.

### 3. User Permissions & Security Protocols

Fine-tune access controls by avoiding universal admin status and granting users only necessary role-based permissions.

### 4. Minimize Admin Access

Restrict admin-level permissions to a small group of individuals to reduce unauthorized modification risks.

### 5. Private Sensitive Dashboards

Keep confidential data restricted by preventing general users from accessing sensitive dashboards.

### 6. Third-Party Integration Auditing

Review how integrated tools access and handle CRM data to ensure proper data protection practices.

## Conclusion

No ideal CRM exists universally. Organizations must develop a security approach tailored to their specific needs, establishing equilibrium among user experience, reporting capabilities, and data protection.
