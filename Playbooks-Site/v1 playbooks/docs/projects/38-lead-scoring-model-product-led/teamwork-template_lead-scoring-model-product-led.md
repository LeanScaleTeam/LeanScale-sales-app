### Task List: (Lead Scoring PLG) 1. Discovery & Data Assessment
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Define Scoring Objectives and Success Criteria | 2.5h | Align stakeholders on what the lead scoring model needs to achieve and how success will be measured. End state: Documented objectives with specific conversion targets and agreement on what constitutes a "sales-ready" PQL.<br /><br />• Conduct stakeholder interviews with Sales, Marketing, and Product to understand current lead prioritization pain points<br />• Document specific goals (e.g., increase trial-to-paid conversion by 25%, reduce time spent on unqualified leads by 40%)<br />• Define the threshold score that triggers sales engagement (e.g., score of 80+ = PQL for outreach)<br />• Establish baseline metrics for current trial conversion rates, sales cycle length, and lead-to-opportunity ratios<br />• Get executive sign-off on scoring objectives and success criteria |
| 2. Map Ideal Customer Profile to Scoring Criteria | 2.5h | Translate the ICP into specific firmographic and demographic attributes that can be scored. End state: Documented list of fit criteria with relative weightings agreed upon by Sales and Marketing.<br /><br />• Review closed-won deals from past 12 months to identify common firmographic patterns (company size, industry, tech stack)<br />• Document negative fit indicators (company too small, wrong industry, competitor employee)<br />• Assign point values to fit attributes based on correlation with conversion (e.g., ICP industry = +20 points, wrong industry = -15 points)<br />• Validate scoring weights with Sales leadership to ensure alignment with their qualification criteria<br />• Create fit scoring matrix showing all attributes and their point values |
| 3. Identify Product Usage Signals for Behavioral Scoring | 2.5h | Determine which product engagement behaviors correlate with buying intent and conversion. End state: Prioritized list of product usage signals with point values based on predictive value.<br /><br />• Analyze product analytics data to identify usage patterns of converted users vs. churned trials<br />• Identify key activation milestones that correlate with conversion (e.g., first integration, invited teammates, used core feature 3+ times)<br />• Document engagement frequency thresholds (e.g., logged in 5+ times in first week = high intent)<br />• Map feature usage to buying signals (e.g., used enterprise-only features during trial = expansion opportunity)<br />• Weight product signals 3-5x higher than demographic data based on PLG best practices |
| 4. Audit Current Data Sources and Quality | 2h | Assess available data sources and identify gaps in the data needed for scoring. End state: Data audit report showing what data exists, where it lives, and what's missing.<br /><br />• Inventory all data sources: CRM (Salesforce/HubSpot), product analytics (Segment, Amplitude, Mixpanel), enrichment tools (Clay, Clearbit, ZoomInfo)<br />• Assess data quality and completeness for key scoring fields (job title fill rate, company size accuracy)<br />• Identify product usage events currently tracked vs. needed for scoring<br />• Document data flow between systems (how product data gets to CRM)<br />• Flag gaps that need to be addressed before scoring implementation |
| 5. Design Data Integration Architecture | 2.5h | Plan how product usage data will flow into the CRM/MAP to power scoring. End state: Architecture diagram showing data sources, integration methods, and destination fields.<br /><br />• Map product events that need to sync to CRM/MAP (via Segment, native integration, or custom API)<br />• Define custom fields needed in CRM to store product usage data (last login date, feature usage flags, activation status)<br />• Determine sync frequency requirements (real-time vs. daily batch for different signals)<br />• Document any data transformation logic needed (e.g., aggregating events into scores)<br />• Create technical specification for engineering team if custom integration work is required |

### Task List: (Lead Scoring PLG) 2. Scoring Build & Integration
**Contains:** Parts 3-4

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 6. Build Fit Scoring Rules in CRM/MAP | 3h | Configure demographic and firmographic scoring rules in the marketing automation platform or CRM. End state: Fit scoring rules live and automatically scoring new leads on firmographic criteria.<br /><br />• Create scoring property/field in HubSpot, Marketo, or Salesforce to store fit score<br />• Build positive scoring rules for ICP fit attributes (industry match, company size range, job title/seniority)<br />• Build negative scoring rules for disqualifying attributes (competitor, student, wrong geography)<br />• Configure scoring rules to fire on lead creation and when enrichment data updates<br />• Test with sample records to verify fit scoring calculates correctly |
| 7. Build Behavioral Scoring Rules for Product Usage | 3.5h | Configure product engagement scoring rules that assign points based on usage signals. End state: Behavioral scoring rules live and automatically scoring leads based on product activity.<br /><br />• Create behavioral score property/field separate from fit score<br />• Build scoring rules for activation milestones (completed onboarding, first key action, invited users)<br />• Configure engagement frequency scoring (login frequency, session count, feature breadth)<br />• Build scoring rules for high-intent actions (viewed pricing, started upgrade flow, used premium features)<br />• Implement negative scoring for inactivity (subtract points after 14+ days of no login) |
| 8. Configure Score Decay and Recency Logic | 3h | Implement time-based decay rules to ensure scores reflect current intent, not stale engagement. End state: Decay rules automatically reduce scores for inactive leads, keeping the pipeline fresh.<br /><br />• Configure decay rules to subtract points after defined inactivity periods (e.g., -10 points per 30 days of no engagement)<br />• Weight recent actions higher than older actions (demo request this week > demo request 30 days ago)<br />• Build engagement velocity bonuses (e.g., +25 points if 5+ key actions in 48 hours)<br />• Set floor scores to prevent decay from pushing scores negative<br />• Test decay logic with historical leads to verify it properly surfaces active prospects |
| 9. Create Combined Lead Score and PQL Threshold | 3h | Combine fit and behavioral scores into a single actionable lead score with defined PQL thresholds. End state: Combined lead score field that triggers PQL status at defined threshold.<br /><br />• Create combined lead score formula (e.g., Fit Score + Behavioral Score = Total Lead Score)<br />• Define PQL threshold based on historical conversion data (score at which leads convert at target rate)<br />• Build PQL flag/status that triggers when threshold is reached<br />• Configure notifications to sales when leads reach PQL status<br />• Document scoring model logic in a reference sheet for stakeholder visibility |
| 10. Connect Product Analytics to CRM/MAP | 3.5h | Implement the data pipeline to flow product usage events into the scoring system. End state: Product usage data syncing to CRM in near-real-time, populating the fields that drive behavioral scoring.<br /><br />• Configure Segment/CDP to send key events to CRM/MAP destination<br />• Alternatively, set up native product analytics integration (e.g., HubSpot product tracking, Salesforce Engage)<br />• Verify events are populating correct fields in CRM<br />• Test event latency to ensure acceptable delay between product action and score update<br />• Document the event mapping for ongoing maintenance |
| 11. Build Sales Alert and Assignment Workflows | 3h | Create automation that notifies sales reps when leads become PQLs and assigns them appropriately. End state: Sales reps receive real-time alerts for new PQLs with context on why the lead qualified.<br /><br />• Build workflow triggered when lead reaches PQL threshold<br />• Configure lead assignment logic (round-robin, territory-based, or account-based)<br />• Create email/Slack notification to assigned rep with key context (score, top behaviors, fit details)<br />• Build CRM task creation for PQL follow-up with suggested messaging<br />• Test end-to-end flow from product action to sales notification |
