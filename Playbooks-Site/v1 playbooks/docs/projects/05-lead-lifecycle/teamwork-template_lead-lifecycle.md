---

### Task List: (Lead Lifecycle) 1. Discovery & Stage Definition
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Conduct Stakeholder Interviews | 2h | Meet with key stakeholders (marketing, sales, RevOps) to understand current pain points, business objectives, and how they conceptualize the lead funnel today. End state: Documented requirements and stakeholder alignment on project goals.<br /><br />• Schedule 30-45 min interviews with VP Marketing, VP Sales, and RevOps lead<br />• Document how each team currently defines "qualified" leads and hand-off points<br />• Identify existing friction points in lead hand-offs between teams<br />• Gather any existing documentation on sales/marketing processes or SLAs<br />• Capture terminology preferences and any industry frameworks they reference (Forrester/SiriusDecisions, Winning by Design) |
| 2. Audit Current CRM Lead Data and Configuration | 2h | Assess how leads are currently tracked in the CRM, including existing status fields, automation rules, and data quality. End state: Gap analysis showing what exists vs. what's needed.<br /><br />• Pull report of all leads by current status values (identify messy/inconsistent statuses)<br />• Document existing lead status picklist values and their definitions (if any)<br />• Check for existing automation rules that update lead status<br />• Identify if stage timestamp fields exist (e.g., MQL Date, SQL Date)<br />• Assess data quality: duplicate leads, leads with no status, leads stuck in limbo stages<br />• Quantify the gap (e.g., "60% of leads have no clear status, no timestamp tracking exists") |
| 3. Document Current State Process Map | 2h | Map the actual current lead flow from creation to closed-won (or disqualified), including all hand-off points and decision criteria. End state: Visual process map of current state with pain points identified.<br /><br />• Create flowchart showing lead sources and entry points<br />• Map current hand-off triggers between marketing and sales<br />• Identify where leads fall through the cracks (common leakage points)<br />• Document manual processes that should be automated<br />• Flag inconsistencies between how different reps handle lead progression |
| 4. Design Stage Architecture | 2h | Define the lifecycle stages that leads will move through, aligned with industry best practices and stakeholder input. End state: Approved list of 5-7 lead stages with clear naming.<br /><br />• Review industry frameworks (Forrester Demand Waterfall, Winning by Design Bowtie)<br />• Propose stage structure (e.g., New, Marketing Qualified, Sales Accepted, Working, Meeting Set, Opportunity Created, Disqualified)<br />• Limit stages to 5-7 maximum to avoid overcomplexity<br />• Ensure stages are action-oriented and measurable<br />• Present stage proposal to stakeholders for approval |
| 5. Document Stage Entry Criteria | 2h | Define the specific, objective criteria required for a lead to enter each stage. End state: Written criteria document that leaves no room for interpretation.<br /><br />• Define MQL criteria (e.g., specific actions like demo request, content download + ICP fit)<br />• Define Sales Accepted criteria (e.g., ICP verified, valid contact info, budget timeline confirmed)<br />• Define Working/Engaged criteria (e.g., sales rep has made contact, discovery scheduled)<br />• Define Meeting Set criteria (e.g., confirmed meeting on calendar with decision-maker)<br />• Define Disqualified criteria and sub-reasons (bad fit, no budget, competitor, bad data)<br />• Get sign-off from both marketing and sales leadership on criteria |
| 6. Establish Stage Transition Rules | 1.5h | Define what triggers a lead to move from one stage to the next, including both automated triggers and manual updates. End state: Documented transition logic ready for CRM configuration.<br /><br />• Map which transitions should be automated (e.g., form submission triggers MQL)<br />• Map which transitions require manual rep action (e.g., Sales Accepted after review)<br />• Define time-based rules (e.g., auto-disqualify after 90 days of no activity)<br />• Document reverse transitions (e.g., Working back to Nurture if discovery cancelled)<br />• Specify what data updates are required at each transition (fields to populate) |

### Task List: (Lead Lifecycle) 2. Implementation & Rollout
**Contains:** Parts 3-4

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 7. Create Lead Status Fields and Picklist Values | 2h | Configure the CRM with the defined lead status picklist and any supporting fields. End state: Lead Status field updated with new values, old values deprecated.<br /><br />• Create or update Lead Status picklist with approved values<br />• Add Lead Stage field if using stage vs. status distinction<br />• Create "Previous Status" field for transition tracking (optional)<br />• Deprecate or merge old status values (create mapping for data migration)<br />• Test field visibility across user profiles |
| 8. Create Stage Timestamp Fields | 2h | Build timestamp fields to capture when leads enter each stage, enabling velocity and time-in-stage reporting. End state: Date/time fields for each stage that auto-populate on transition.<br /><br />• Create date/time field for each stage (e.g., MQL_Date__c, SAL_Date__c, SQL_Date__c)<br />• Create formula fields for time-in-stage calculations (e.g., Days_in_MQL__c)<br />• Consider creating a "First Stage Hit" vs. "Most Recent Stage Hit" distinction<br />• Test timestamp field updates in sandbox<br />• Document field API names for reporting and integration use |
| 9. Build Automation Rules for Stage Transitions | 3.5h | Configure automation (Salesforce Flow, HubSpot Workflows) to automatically update lead status and timestamp fields based on defined triggers. End state: Automated transitions working for all defined trigger scenarios.<br /><br />• Build automation for inbound lead creation (source-based initial status)<br />• Build automation for MQL qualification (form submissions, lead score threshold)<br />• Build automation for time-based transitions (stale lead disqualification)<br />• Build automation for timestamp population on each stage change<br />• Configure notifications/alerts for sales on key transitions (new MQL assigned)<br />• Test all automation paths with sample records |
| 10. Integrate Marketing Automation Platform | 2.5h | Ensure lead status and lifecycle data syncs correctly between CRM and marketing automation platform. End state: Bidirectional sync working with no data conflicts.<br /><br />• Map CRM Lead Status field to MAP lifecycle stage field<br />• Configure sync direction for each field (CRM-wins vs. MAP-wins)<br />• Set up sync filters to prevent bad data from syncing<br />• Test sync with new leads and status changes<br />• Document sync logic for future troubleshooting |
| 11. Test Lifecycle Implementation with Pilot Group | 2h | Run the new lifecycle with a small group of leads and reps to validate all transitions, automations, and reporting work correctly. End state: Pilot validated with issues identified and resolved.<br /><br />• Select 50-100 leads across various stages for pilot testing<br />• Assign 2-3 reps to work pilot leads using new lifecycle<br />• Monitor for automation failures or unexpected behavior<br />• Gather rep feedback on usability and stage definitions<br />• Fix issues identified during pilot before full rollout |
| 12. Build Lifecycle Reporting and Dashboards | 3h | Create reports and dashboards showing lead funnel metrics, conversion rates, and velocity. End state: Live dashboard accessible to sales and marketing leadership.<br /><br />• Build conversion rate report (MQL to SAL, SAL to SQL, SQL to Opp, Opp to CW)<br />• Build velocity report (average days in each stage)<br />• Build volume report (leads by stage over time)<br />• Build leakage report (disqualified leads by reason)<br />• Create executive dashboard with key lifecycle KPIs<br />• Set up scheduled report delivery to leadership |
| 13. Train Sales and Marketing Teams | 2h | Train all users on the new lifecycle stages, definitions, and their responsibilities for updating lead status.
