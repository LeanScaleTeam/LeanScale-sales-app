| 5. Assess Data Availability for Required KPIs | 2.5h | Map each required KPI to its data source and evaluate whether the data exists and is accessible. End state: Gap analysis showing which KPIs can be built now vs. require upstream fixes.<br /><br />• For each P0 KPI, identify the source system and specific fields needed<br />• Validate that historical data exists (12+ months preferred for trend analysis)<br />• Document data gaps: metrics that can't be calculated with current data<br />• Identify data hygiene issues that must be fixed before dashboard build<br />• Prioritize upstream fixes that block critical KPIs<br />• Create remediation plan for data gaps with timeline |
| 6. Design Dashboard Architecture | 3h | Design the technical architecture for how data flows from source systems to dashboards, including refresh schedules and visualization approach. End state: Architecture diagram and visualization spec for each dashboard.<br /><br />• Map data flow from source systems through integration layer to BI platform<br />• Define refresh schedules (real-time for pipeline, daily for financial metrics)<br />• Select visualization types for each KPI (trend lines for ARR, funnels for conversion, gauges for attainment)<br />• Design dashboard hierarchy: executive summary → role-specific views → drill-down detail<br />• Plan for alerting: which thresholds trigger notifications<br />• Document technical requirements for BI platform (Looker LookML, Tableau workbooks) |
