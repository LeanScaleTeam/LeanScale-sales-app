## Risks and Challenges

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Organizations at Platform stage face institutional risks — organizational drag, governance paralysis, and complexity that slows everything down. The challenge is durability, not growth.

## Common Risks at Platform Stage

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Organizational Drag** | Too many approvals, slow decision-making | Decision rights clarity, empowerment at edges |
| **Cross-Org Misalignment** | Sales, Marketing, CS, Product silos | Operating cadences, shared metrics, clear handoffs |
| **Governance Paralysis** | Compliance and process killing speed | Right-size governance, fast-track for low-risk |
| **Complexity Creep** | Multi-product, multi-geo, multi-segment complexity | Simplification initiatives, ruthless prioritization |
| **Talent Drain** | Top performers leaving for earlier-stage companies | Career paths, equity refreshes, autonomy |
| **Innovation Stagnation** | Optimizing today at expense of tomorrow | Innovation budget, protected R&D, new bets |
| **M&A Integration Failure** | Acquiring without integrating | Dedicated integration team, 100-day plans |
| **Customer Concentration** | Over-reliance on top customers | Diversification, segment balance |
| **Market Disruption** | New entrants, technology shifts | Competitive intelligence, strategic planning |

## Leading Indicators of Trouble

| Signal | What It Indicates | Action |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| **Win rate declining** | Competitive pressure or execution issues | Win/loss analysis, competitive response |
| **NRR declining** | Customer health or product issues | Churn analysis, product investment |
| **Rep attrition increasing** | Comp, culture, or management issues | Stay interviews, comp review |
| **Pipeline quality declining** | Marketing or ICP issues | Demand gen review, ICP validation |
| **Time-to-close increasing** | Buyer hesitation or process bloat | Sales process review |

## Strategic Risk Management

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Quarterly Risk Review** | GTM leadership reviews risks and mitigations |
| **Competitive Intelligence** | Ongoing monitoring, win/loss, analyst briefings |
| **Customer Health Dashboard** | Real-time visibility into retention risks |
| **Scenario Planning** | Downside planning for market shifts |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Ignoring early signals** — by the time problems are obvious, they're expensive to fix
> - **Optimizing only** — efficiency without innovation is a slow decline
> - **Complexity denial** — "we've always done it this way" kills platform-stage companies
