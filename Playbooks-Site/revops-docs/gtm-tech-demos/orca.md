## Overview

This page features a transcript and demonstration of Orca, an AI-first customer support platform designed specifically for B2B companies. Tony Tom, founder and CEO, discusses how the platform centralizes post-sales functions around accounts rather than individual tickets.

## Key Topics Discussed

### Problem Statement

Traditional support systems struggle with distributed customer data across multiple channels (Slack, email, Discord). Support teams lack visibility into complete account context, making it difficult to surface customer needs to product teams effectively.

### Core Solution

Orca implements "account-centric" design philosophy: "an AI first customer support platform for B2B companies specifically built with account as the centerpiece." This contrasts with typical ticketing systems where individual tickets drive the architecture.

## Main Features

### Channel Integration

- Consolidates conversations from Slack, email, Discord, and community platforms
- Auto-groups related messages using AI pattern recognition
- Creates unified account timelines with sentiment analytics

### AI-Powered Context Synthesis

- Analyzes pre-sales data, CRM records, call recordings, and documentation
- Suggests technical responses with relevant documentation links
- Converts Loom videos into step-by-step documentation automatically

### Workflow Automation

- Auto-triage and intelligent routing based on conditions
- SLA monitoring and sentiment-driven escalations
- Internal discussion threads without customer visibility

### Data Intelligence

- Sentiment analysis across customer interactions
- Feature utilization tracking
- Stakeholder vs. end-user satisfaction differentiation
