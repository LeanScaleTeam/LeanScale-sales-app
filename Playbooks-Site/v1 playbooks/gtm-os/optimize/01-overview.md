# Stage 4: Optimize ($15–$40M ARR)

## Overview

## What This Stage Is About

- The team is built, processes exist — now the question is efficiency and leverage
- Discovering that "more" doesn't equal "better" — adding headcount without optimizing often worsens unit economics
- Margin erosion as a real concern — costs growing faster than revenue signals problems
- Segment specialization becoming necessary — different customers need different motions
- Data maturity enabling real analysis — decisions can now be made from dashboards, not instinct
- Process bloat becoming visible — things that were "good enough" at Scale now create drag

## What Breaks at This Stage

- **Unit economics decay** — CAC rising, payback extending, magic number declining without intervention
- **Process bureaucracy** — approvals and handoffs multiply without clear value
- **Reporting overload** — more dashboards than insights, more meetings than decisions
- **Misaligned incentives** — comp plans driving behaviors that worked at Scale but hurt at Optimize
- **Innovation stagnation** — so focused on optimizing that growth opportunities get missed
- **Segment confusion** — not clear which segments get which resources, motion, or attention

## Main Goal
 Turn scale into efficiency — improve unit economics, specialize by segment, and remove friction without losing growth momentum.

## Typical Firmographics

- Revenue: $15–$40M ARR
- Headcount: 80–200
- Fundraising: Series B or C
- GTM Complexity: High — specialization by segment, region, and motion
- Product Complexity: Multiple SKUs, pricing complexity, reliability expectations
- Board Dynamics: Unit economics and efficiency metrics under scrutiny
