# Stage 2: Stabilize ($1–$5M ARR)

## Overview

## What This Stage Is About

- Proving the motion works without founder magic
- First real GTM hires — and the handoff chaos that comes with them
- Pipeline becoming real (and revealing it was never as healthy as you thought)
- CRM becoming a mess because nobody set it up right
- Discovering that "it just worked" was actually founder relationships, not a repeatable process

The transition from Build to Stabilize is brutal. Everything that worked with founder intuition starts breaking. The first sales rep can't close. Marketing leads don't convert. CS is overwhelmed. Teams get caught between "doing things that don't scale" and "we need to scale."

## Typical Firmographics

- Revenue: $1–$5M ARR
- Headcount: 10–30
- Fundraising: Seed / Series A
- GTM Complexity: Low–Medium — first GTM roles, basic funnel, early segmentation
- Product Complexity: Core product stabilizing, early roadmap pressure

## Main Goal
 Prove the sales motion works without the founder doing everything. Build the foundation that lets the organization add capacity without chaos.
