## Milestone 1: CRM-ERP Integration - 1. Discovery & Architecture
**Tag:** `crm-erp`
**Description:** Document current system architecture, gather stakeholder requirements, map data fields, and select integration approach.
**Hours:** 38h

### Task List: (CRM-ERP Integration) 1. Discovery & Architecture
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Audit Current System Architecture | 6h | Document existing CRM and ERP configurations to understand current state, identify fields/objects that need synchronization, and uncover data quality issues. End state: Complete technical inventory of both systems with data quality assessment.<br /><br />• Pull field-level documentation from CRM (Salesforce/HubSpot) including custom objects, fields, and picklist values<br />• Export ERP data dictionary covering chart of accounts, customer master, product/item catalog, and sales order structure<br />• Document API capabilities and limitations for both platforms (REST/SOAP availability, rate limits, authentication methods)<br />• Run data quality audit on both systems—identify duplicate records, incomplete fields, and inconsistent formatting (research shows 91% of CRM data is incomplete)<br />• Assess current data governance: which system is source of truth for customer data, products, and pricing |
| 2. Gather Stakeholder Requirements | 5h | Interview Sales, Finance, and RevOps stakeholders to identify pain points, define priority use cases, and establish success criteria. End state: Documented requirements from all key stakeholders with prioritized use case list.<br /><br />• Conduct 30-45 minute interviews with VP Sales, Finance Controller, and RevOps lead<br />• Document current manual workflows and time spent on data entry between systems<br />• Identify pain points: delayed invoicing, data discrepancies, revenue reporting gaps, order-to-cash friction<br />• Define priority use cases ranked by business impact (e.g., opportunity-to-sales-order, invoice status sync, payment reconciliation)<br />• Establish success criteria with measurable targets (e.g., "reduce manual entry by 90%", "sync within 15 minutes of close") |
| 3. Create Data Mapping Matrix | 7h | Map data fields between CRM and ERP systems to identify matches, gaps, and transformation requirements. End state: Complete field mapping document specifying source, target, transformation rules, and sync direction.<br /><br />• Map Account/Customer fields: company name, billing address, shipping address, payment terms, credit limits<br />• Map Contact fields: name, email, phone, role, primary contact flag<br />• Map Opportunity/Sales Order fields: amount, products/line items, discount, close date, stage<br />• Map Product/Item fields: SKU, name, price, quantity, unit of measure<br />• Document transformation requirements: state/country standardization, currency conversion, date format alignment<br />• Define sync direction for each field (CRM→ERP, ERP→CRM, or bi-directional) and identify conflict resolution rules |
| 4. Evaluate Integration Approaches | 6h | Compare integration options (native connectors, middleware, custom API) against client's technical capabilities and requirements. End state: Selected integration approach with documented rationale.<br /><br />• Assess native connector options (e.g., Salesforce Connect, HubSpot Operations Hub, built-in ERP connectors)<br />• Evaluate middleware platforms: Celigo, Workato, Dell Boomi, MuleSoft, Jitterbit<br />• Consider iPaaS vs custom API development based on complexity and internal technical resources<br />• Compare options on: implementation time, ongoing maintenance, cost, scalability, error handling capabilities<br />• Document recommendation with pros/cons for client decision |
| 5. Define Technical Specifications | 7h | Document detailed technical requirements including authentication, sync frequency, error handling, and monitoring. End state: Technical specification document ready for implementation.<br /><br />• Specify authentication method (OAuth 2.0, API keys, token-based) for each system<br />• Define sync frequency by data type: real-time for closed-won opportunities, hourly for customer updates, daily for invoice status<br />• Document API rate limits and design throttling strategy to avoid hitting limits<br />• Specify error handling requirements: retry logic, failure notifications, manual override procedures<br />• Define data validation rules to prevent bad data from syncing (required fields, format validation, referential integrity) |
| 6. Establish Data Governance Rules | 7h | Define ownership, conflict resolution, and governance policies for shared data elements. End state: Data governance matrix documenting system of record for each data type.<br /><br />• Designate system of record for each data type: ERP owns billing address, payment terms; CRM owns contacts, opportunity details<br />• Define conflict resolution rules when data differs between systems (timestamp-based, source priority, manual review)<br />• Establish data stewardship: who reviews and resolves sync failures, who approves data model changes<br />• Document compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC2) and how integration handles PII<br />• Create change management process for field additions or modifications |

| 9. Build Opportunity/Sales Order Sync | 10h | Implement the core sync workflow that creates ERP sales orders from closed-won CRM opportunities. End state: Closed-won opportunities automatically generate sales orders in ERP with correct line items.<br /><br />• Build trigger on Opportunity Stage = Closed Won (or equivalent custom stage)<br />• Map opportunity line items to ERP sales order line items including product, quantity, price, discount<br />• Handle multi-currency scenarios with exchange rate logic<br />• Implement validation: verify customer exists in ERP before creating sales order, create if missing<br />• Build approval workflow handling for discounts that exceed ERP policy thresholds<br />• Test with opportunities including multiple line items, discounts, and various product types |
