## Overview

This page features a comprehensive interview and product demonstration with Yogi Pajabi, founder and CEO of PeopleLens, an AI-powered sales coaching platform designed to improve sales team performance through data-driven insights and personalized coaching.

## Key Topics Discussed

### Founder's Journey

Yogi's background spans strategy, sales, marketing, product, and people analytics. His inspiration came from addressing a critical challenge at Palo Alto Networks during 2018-2019, when rapid acquisitions (17 in 5 quarters) created a go-to-market execution mismatch. After missing two quarters, the team discovered that targeted coaching—transforming one underperforming rep from a "$50K box seller" to a "seven-figure SAS seller"—could drive significant revenue improvements.

### Four Pillars of PeopleLens Platform

1. **Data Unification**: Integrates CRM, calendars, enablement systems, engagement tools, and conversation data across the enterprise
2. **Proprietary Models**: Runs AI algorithms on both structured and unstructured data to generate actionable insights
3. **Persona-Based Lenses**: Provides tailored dashboards for executives, managers, and individual contributors
4. **Personalized Nudges**: Delivers targeted, AI-driven performance recommendations via multiple channels (CRM, calendar, Slack)

## Three User Personas and Their Benefits

### Manager Lens (Leila's view)

- Identifies underperformers and performance drivers
- Early engagement of economic buyers can improve deal close rates by approximately 15%
- Tracks key metrics: MEDDIC score, customer time allocation, email response rates

### Rep Lens (Whitney's view)

- Personal dashboard tracking outcomes, meetings, pipeline, and learning
- Monitors active vs. completed coaching nudges
- Connects coaching actions to performance outcomes

### Executive Lens (Cynthia's view)

- Team attainment overview with three core performance drivers
- Identifies high performers and development opportunities
- Surfaces "massive middle" segment for targeted coaching investments

### Integration Ecosystem

The platform acts as "connective tissue" across 30+ go-to-market tools through pre-built APIs connecting to Salesforce, communication tools, calendars, and enablement systems. Pilot deployment takes approximately 30 days.

## Strategic Insights

### Optimal Deployment Timing

Best adoption occurs during methodology introductions (MEDDIC, SPICED, value selling) or when leadership needs to validate hypotheses about performance blockers.

### Attrition and Capacity Planning

The discussion emphasizes that losing reps costs nearly 18 months of revenue impact—making coaching investments for middle performers significantly more cost-effective than replacement and ramp cycles.

### Data Silos Problem

Organizations typically run 30+ disconnected tools but struggle converting this data into actionable insights for frontline coaching conversations.
