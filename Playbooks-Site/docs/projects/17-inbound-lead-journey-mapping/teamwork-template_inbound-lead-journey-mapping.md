### Task List: (Inbound Lead Journey Mapping) 1. Discovery & Data Analysis
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Clarify Journey Mapping Objectives | 1.5h | Align with stakeholders on the specific goals of the journey mapping exercise and define success criteria. End state: Documented objectives with stakeholder sign-off on scope.<br /><br />• Schedule kickoff meeting with Marketing, Sales, and RevOps leadership<br />• Define primary objective (e.g., improve MQL-to-SQL conversion, reduce speed-to-lead, identify drop-off points)<br />• Identify which inbound channels are in scope (website forms, content downloads, demo requests, chat, events)<br />• Agree on the journey stages to map (awareness through opportunity creation or through closed-won)<br />• Document success criteria for the mapping exercise<br />• Get stakeholder sign-off on scope and timeline |
| 2. Interview Cross-Functional Stakeholders | 2h | Gather qualitative input from Marketing, Sales, and Operations on their perception of the current lead journey. End state: Interview notes capturing pain points and expectations from each team.<br /><br />• Conduct 30-minute interviews with 2-3 Marketing team members (demand gen, content, ops)<br />• Conduct 30-minute interviews with 2-3 Sales team members (SDRs, AEs, sales management)<br />• Interview RevOps/Sales Ops on current lead lifecycle definitions and processes<br />• Ask each stakeholder: "Where do you see leads stalling or going dark?"<br />• Document conflicting definitions or language between teams (MQL, SQL, handoff criteria)<br />• Summarize findings in stakeholder input document |
| 3. Extract Lead Behavior Data from CRM | 2h | Pull quantitative data on lead progression, conversion rates, and timing from the CRM. End state: Dataset showing lead flow through stages with conversion metrics at each stage.<br /><br />• Pull lead reports from Salesforce/HubSpot for last 90 days (or 6 months for lower volume)<br />• Extract data on lead sources, status changes, and stage durations<br />• Calculate conversion rates at each stage (Lead → MQL → SQL → Opportunity)<br />• Identify average time-in-stage for each lifecycle step<br />• Segment data by lead source (organic, paid, referral, events) to spot channel differences<br />• Export data to spreadsheet for analysis |
| 4. Gather Marketing Automation & Web Analytics Data | 2h | Collect engagement data from marketing automation platform and website analytics to understand pre-CRM behavior. End state: Engagement data showing content consumption, email engagement, and website behavior patterns.<br /><br />• Pull email engagement metrics from HubSpot/Marketo/Pardot (open rates, click rates by campaign)<br />• Extract landing page conversion rates from marketing automation or GA4<br />• Identify most common content assets consumed before form submission<br />• Analyze website behavior patterns (pages viewed, session duration, exit pages)<br />• Map typical content journey: first touch → form fill → conversion<br />• Document channels driving highest-quality leads (by downstream conversion rate) |
| 5. Identify Drop-Off Points and Friction Areas | 2h | Analyze the data to pinpoint where leads stall, drop off, or fail to convert. End state: Prioritized list of drop-off points with quantified impact.<br /><br />• Calculate drop-off percentage at each stage transition (Lead → MQL → SQL)<br />• Identify stages with longest average time-in-stage (indicates friction)<br />• Compare conversion rates across lead sources to spot underperformers<br />• Analyze "dark leads" - leads that go inactive without converting<br />• Quantify the revenue impact of each drop-off point<br />• Rank friction points by severity and revenue impact |

### Task List: (Inbound Lead Journey Mapping) 2. Journey Mapping & Delivery
**Contains:** Parts 3-5

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 6. Define Buyer Personas for the Journey | 1.5h | Document the key buyer personas that represent inbound leads to ensure the journey map reflects real buyer behavior. End state: 2-3 defined personas with their typical journey characteristics.<br /><br />• Review existing persona documentation (if available)<br />• Identify 2-3 primary personas based on lead data and sales input<br />• Document each persona's typical entry point (content type, channel)<br />• Map persona-specific content preferences and engagement patterns<br />• Note persona-specific friction points identified in data analysis<br />• Validate personas with Sales and Marketing stakeholders |
| 7. Map All Touchpoints Across Stages | 2h | Document every touchpoint a lead encounters from first engagement through handoff to Sales. End state: Complete touchpoint inventory organized by journey stage.<br /><br />• List all awareness stage touchpoints (blog, SEO, paid ads, social, events)<br />• List all consideration stage touchpoints (gated content, webinars, case studies)<br />• List all decision stage touchpoints (demo requests, pricing pages, sales conversations)<br />• Document automated touchpoints (nurture emails, retargeting, chatbot)<br />• Document human touchpoints (SDR outreach, sales calls, demo meetings)<br />• Map touchpoints to CRM/marketing automation triggers and actions |

End state: Visual journey map document ready for stakeholder review.<br /><br />• Select mapping tool (Miro, Lucidchart, Figma, or PowerPoint)<br />• Create journey stages as horizontal lanes (Awareness → Consideration → Decision → Handoff)<br />• Plot touchpoints within each stage lane<br />• Add conversion points between stages with conversion rate metrics<br />• Highlight drop-off points and friction areas with red flags<br />• Add persona swim lanes if journeys differ significantly by persona<br />• Include time-in-stage metrics at each transition |
| 9. Prioritize Optimization Opportunities | 2h | Translate identified friction points into prioritized, actionable recommendations. End state: Prioritized recommendation list with expected impact and effort estimates.<br /><br />• Review all identified friction points and drop-off areas<br />• Generate 2-3 potential solutions for each friction point<br />• Estimate impact of each solution (% improvement, leads recovered, revenue)<br />• Estimate effort/cost for each solution (hours, tools, resources)<br />• Prioritize recommendations using impact/effort matrix<br />• Select top 5-7 recommendations for presentation |
| 10. Document Handoff Criteria and Stage Definitions | 1.5h | Create clear, agreed-upon definitions for each lead stage and handoff criteria between Marketing and Sales.
