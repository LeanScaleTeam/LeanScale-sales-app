## Tech Stack

**Principle:** Right-size your tools. Upgrade from free tiers where you're hitting limits, but don't over-invest in enterprise tools.

You're not Build stage anymore — some tools need upgrading. But you're not Scale either — don't buy enterprise stack.

| Category                 | Recommendation                           | Why This Stage                | Upgrade From Build    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **CRM** | HubSpot Starter/Pro or Salesforce Essentials | Pipeline management, reporting, team access | Free tier limitations |
| **Marketing Automation** | HubSpot Marketing Starter or Mailchimp Pro | Real nurture flows, tracking | Free tier email limits |
| **Enrichment** | Clay Growth or Clearbit (starter) | Higher volume, better data | Manual or Clay starter |
| **Sales Engagement** | Apollo, Outreach, or HubSpot sequences | Reps need scalable outreach | Manual email |
| **Customer Support** | Intercom or Zendesk Starter | Ticketing, knowledge base | Email/Slack |
| **Call Recording** | Gong Essentials or Fireflies Pro | Rep coaching, call review | Free tiers |
| **Analytics** | Built-in CRM dashboards | Good enough for now | Spreadsheets |

**Tool selection guidance:**

| Decision | Guidance |
|----------|----------|
| **HubSpot vs Salesforce** | HubSpot if you want simplicity and have SMB/MM focus. Salesforce if you have enterprise ambitions and can invest in admin. |
| **Apollo vs Outreach** | Apollo for startups (cheaper, all-in-one). Outreach for more sophisticated sequences and integrations. |
| **Intercom vs Zendesk** | Intercom for product-led, chat-first. Zendesk for ticket-heavy, traditional support. |

**Stabilize stage tool pricing (2025):**

| Tool | Tier | Price | Notes |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| **HubSpot** | Starter | $20/user/mo | Often 50%+ off first year |
| **HubSpot** | Pro | ~$100/user/mo | Adds workflows, custom reporting |
| **Salesforce** | Starter Suite | $25/user/mo | Basic CRM, max 325 users |
| **Apollo** | Basic | $49/user/mo (annual) | 5,000 credits/mo |
| **Apollo** | Pro | $79/user/mo (annual) | 10,000 credits, A/B testing |
| **Gong** | - | ~$1,400-1,600/user/yr + $5K platform fee | Revenue intelligence; often overkill at Stabilize |

**When to upgrade tools:**

- You're hitting hard limits (contacts, emails, users)
- You need features behind the paywall (custom reports, workflows)
- Your team can't work efficiently with current tools
- Data quality is suffering (duplicates, missing fields)

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't buy annual contracts for new tools — monthly until proven
- Don't buy tools you don't have capacity to implement
- Don't expect tools to fix process problems — document first, tool later
