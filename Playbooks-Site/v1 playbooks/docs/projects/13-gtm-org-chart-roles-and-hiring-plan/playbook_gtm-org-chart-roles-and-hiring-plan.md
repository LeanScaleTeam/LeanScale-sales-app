# GTM Org Chart/Roles and Responsibilities & Hiring Plan - Playbook

## 1. Definition

**What it is**: A strategic planning project that designs and documents a scalable Go-To-Market organizational structure, defining roles, responsibilities, reporting relationships, career paths, and a phased hiring plan tied to revenue milestones and business objectives.

**What it is NOT**: Not a compensation/quota design project (that's Quotas and Target Setting). Not a headcount budgeting exercise (that's Finance). Not a recruiting/talent acquisition implementation. Not an HR policy or performance management system build.

## 2. ICP Value Proposition

**Pain it solves**: GTM leadership lacks clarity on who owns what, reporting structures are informal or undocumented, and hiring decisions are reactive rather than strategic. New hires don't know their career path, and scaling the team becomes chaotic as revenue grows.

**Outcome delivered**: A complete GTM organizational blueprint including current-state org chart, future-state design tied to revenue triggers, standardized job families with career ladders, and a prioritized hiring plan that tells leadership exactly who to hire and when.

**Who owns it**: VP of Sales, CRO, or CEO (in earlier-stage companies). Often co-owned with Head of People/HR for implementation.

## 3. Implementation Procedure

### Part 1: Current-State Discovery & Assessment

#### Step 1: Conduct GTM Leadership Interviews

**Step Overview:** Interview key GTM leaders to understand existing roles, reporting lines, pain points, and organizational gaps. End state: Documented insights from each leader with common themes identified.

- Schedule 30-45 minute interviews with VP Sales, VP Marketing, VP Customer Success, and RevOps lead
- Ask about current team structure, reporting relationships, and span of control
- Probe for role ambiguity issues (e.g., "Who owns expansion revenue?")
- Document perceived gaps in current structure and skills
- Identify any informal roles or responsibilities not reflected in current documentation
- Compile interview notes into a summary document with recurring themes

#### Step 2: Map Current-State Org Chart

**Step Overview:** Create a visual representation of the current GTM organization across all functions. End state: Complete current-state org chart with all roles, reporting lines, and headcount.

- Gather existing org charts, HRIS data, and employee lists for GTM functions
- Map Sales org (SDRs, AEs, AMs, Sales Management, Sales Ops)

- Map Customer Success org (CSMs, Implementation, Support, CS Ops)
- Map RevOps/GTM Ops structure and reporting relationships
- Include Partnerships/Alliances if applicable
- Document headcount per role and identify any open requisitions

#### Step 3: Identify Structural Gaps and Overlaps

**Step Overview:** Analyze the current org chart against industry benchmarks and interview findings to identify gaps and redundancies. End state: Gap analysis document with prioritized issues.

- Compare current structure to typical B2B SaaS org patterns for company stage
- Identify missing roles critical for current revenue stage (e.g., no dedicated Sales Enablement)
- Flag overlapping responsibilities between roles or departments
- Note span of control issues (managers with too many or too few direct reports)
- Document any roles with unclear ownership or accountability
- Prioritize gaps by impact on revenue and operational efficiency

- Set headcount thresholds for adding management layers
- Identify customer count triggers for CS org expansion
- Map triggers to funding milestones if applicable
- Create decision tree for common scaling scenarios
- Document leading indicators that signal upcoming trigger points

### Part 4: Hiring Plan Development

## 4. Dependencies & Inputs

**What must exist before starting:**
- Access to current org chart or employee list for GTM functions
- Revenue data and growth projections (or access to leadership who can provide)
- HRIS or People team contact for employee data
- Understanding of current compensation bands (if career pathing includes comp)

**What client must provide:**
- Time commitment from GTM leaders for interviews (30-45 min each)
- Historical revenue data and forward projections
- Any existing role documentation or job descriptions
- Budget parameters for hiring plan
- Decision-making authority to approve org design

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- **Pitfall 1: Designing for today instead of 18 months out** - Building an org that works now but doesn't scale leads to constant reorganization. **Mitigation**: Always include revenue triggers and future-state design even for near-term hires.

- **Pitfall 2: Creating new silos while trying to eliminate old ones** - Over-specialization or poor cross-functional alignment in the new design. **Mitigation**: Include cross-functional collaboration requirements in role definitions and design regular coordination touchpoints into the structure.

- **Pitfall 3: Ignoring career path impact on retention** - Unclear progression leads to top talent attrition. **Mitigation**: Ensure every role has a visible next step and document career ladders explicitly.

- **Pitfall 4: Building a hiring plan without budget alignment** - Plans that don't account for financial constraints become shelf-ware. **Mitigation**: Involve Finance early and tie hiring triggers to revenue milestones that fund the new headcount.

## 6. Success Metrics

- **Leading Indicator**: Leadership alignment on future-state design achieved within first 2 weeks; all role definitions documented and approved by project end.
- **Lagging Indicator**: 90-day post-project: Hiring plan on track (planned hires made on schedule), new hires report clarity on role and career path in onboarding surveys.
