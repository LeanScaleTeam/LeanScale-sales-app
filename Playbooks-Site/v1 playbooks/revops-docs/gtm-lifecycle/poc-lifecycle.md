# Proof of Concept Lifecycle

In B2B SaaS, companies often go through a proof of concept (POC) phase before fully committing to a product or service. Managing this phase effectively is critical to conversion success.

## POC Lifecycle Stages

### 1. Designating Prospects

The initial stage involves determining whether prospects should enter the POC process. This is typically decided by:
- Sales engineers
- Customer success teams
- Solution architects

**Key tracking metrics:**
- How many prospects enter this phase
- POC conversion rates
- Average POC duration

### 2. Operational Steps

Establish clear operational steps for the POC including:

- **Technical integration phase** - Setting up the technical environment
- **API connection phase** - Establishing data connections
- **Data transfer phase** - Migrating or syncing relevant data

### 3. Value Assessment

At the conclusion of the POC, evaluate whether it demonstrated expected value. This assessment should be:
- Independent from earlier closed/lost designations
- Based on predefined success criteria
- Documented for future reference

## Entry Criteria

Organizations should document clear entry requirements, such as:

- **Minimum user count** - Ensure adequate usage for valid evaluation
- **Revenue thresholds** - Qualify based on deal size
- **Specific industry or vertical focus** - Target ideal customer profiles
- **Technical requirements** - Confirm prerequisites are met

## Success and Failure Documentation

Recording reasons for positive or negative outcomes helps:
- Improve future POC processes
- Identify common objections
- Increase success likelihood
- Refine qualification criteria

### Common Success Factors
- Clear success criteria defined upfront
- Executive sponsor engagement
- Adequate user adoption during POC
- Demonstrated time-to-value

### Common Failure Factors
- Unclear success metrics
- Lack of stakeholder alignment
- Technical integration challenges
- Insufficient resources allocated

## Best Practices

1. **Set clear timelines** - POCs should have defined start and end dates
2. **Define success criteria** - Agree on what "success" looks like before starting
3. **Assign ownership** - Both internal team and customer should have accountable owners
4. **Regular checkpoints** - Schedule weekly or bi-weekly reviews
5. **Document everything** - Track all interactions and outcomes
