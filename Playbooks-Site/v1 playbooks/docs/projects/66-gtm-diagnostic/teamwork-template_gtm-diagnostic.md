| 2. Request and Validate Systems Access | 1h | Obtain limited, read-only access to all GTM systems required for benchmarking. End state: Access confirmed and validated for CRM, marketing automation, sales engagement, and reporting tools.<br /><br />• Request read-only access to CRM (Salesforce or HubSpot)<br />• Request access to marketing automation platform (HubSpot, Marketo, Pardot)<br />• Request access to sales engagement tools (Outreach, Salesloft, Gong)<br />• Request access to reporting/BI tools if separate from CRM<br />• Validate each access works and document login credentials securely<br />• Confirm data retention period available for analysis (minimum 90 days recommended) |
| 3. Conduct Reverse Demo Session | 1.5h | Have client walk through their current GTM processes, systems, and setup to understand context beyond what data shows. End state: Documented understanding of how the client's GTM actually operates day-to-day.<br /><br />• Schedule 60-90 minute live session with key stakeholders<br />• Have client demonstrate their lead flow from first touch to closed-won<br />• Document how handoffs work between Marketing → SDR → AE → CS<br />• Capture current reporting cadence and which metrics leadership reviews<br />• Note any known pain points, workarounds, or tribal knowledge<br />• Record session for reference during analysis phase |
| 4. Extract and Organize Raw Data | 2h | Pull relevant data exports from all connected systems for offline analysis. End state: Consolidated dataset ready for 80+ checkpoint inspection.<br /><br />• Export lead/contact records with source, status, and conversion dates<br />• Export opportunity data with stage history, close dates, and amounts<br />• Export activity data (emails, calls, meetings) from CRM and engagement tools<br />• Pull marketing campaign performance data (spend, leads, conversions)<br />• Extract current report/dashboard configurations<br />• Organize data into standardized analysis format |

### Task List: (GTM Diagnostic) 2. Analysis & Delivery
**Contains:** Parts 3-4

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 5. Run Systems Inspection Checklist | 1.5h | Evaluate GTM technology stack against best practices for configuration, integration, and utilization. End state: Systems section of Inspection Report complete with red/yellow/green ratings.<br /><br />• Assess CRM data hygiene (required fields, picklist values, duplicate rate)<br />• Evaluate lead routing rules and assignment logic<br />• Check integration health between CRM and marketing automation<br />• Review activity capture settings and sync configurations<br />• Assess user adoption metrics (login frequency, data entry compliance)<br />• Document integration gaps and data silos between tools |
| 6. Analyze Funnel Process and Conversion Metrics | 1.5h | Map the full customer journey and calculate conversion rates at each stage against benchmarks. End state: Funnel section of Inspection Report complete with stage-by-stage analysis.<br /><br />• Map current funnel stages and definitions (MQL, SQL, SAL, Opportunity stages)<br />• Calculate conversion rates between each stage<br />• Benchmark against industry standards for B2B SaaS<br />• Identify stage(s) with largest drop-off or variance from benchmark<br />• Assess lead velocity and time-in-stage metrics<br />• Document handoff SLAs and whether they're being met |
| 7. Evaluate Reporting and Metrics Infrastructure | 1h | Assess what the client is measuring, how they're measuring it, and whether metrics are reliable. End state: Reporting section of Inspection Report complete with data quality assessment.<br /><br />• Inventory existing reports and dashboards<br />• Verify metric definitions are consistent across tools (e.g., MQL definition matches in MAP and CRM)<br />• Check for conflicting data between systems (attribution models, source tracking)<br />• Assess whether leadership has real-time visibility into pipeline and performance<br />• Identify gaps in reporting (metrics they should track but don't)<br />• Rate data trustworthiness on key metrics |
| 8. Calculate Power10 Scorecard Metrics | 1.5h | Compute the ten most critical GTM metrics and score against benchmarks. End state: Power10 Scorecard complete with current values, benchmarks, and gap analysis.<br /><br />• Calculate CAC and CAC payback period<br />• Compute LTV and LTV:CAC ratio<br />• Measure win rate and average deal size<br />• Calculate pipeline coverage and velocity<br />• Assess net revenue retention (NRR) and churn rate<br />• Benchmark each metric against industry standards for company stage<br />• Assign red/yellow/green rating to each of the 10 metrics |
| 9. Compile Inspection Report | 1.5h | Synthesize all findings into the color-coded Inspection Report with 80+ checkpoints. End state: Complete Inspection Report document ready for client presentation.<br /><br />• Organize findings into four sections: Systems, Funnel, Reporting, Performance<br />• Apply red/yellow/green ratings to each of 80+ checkpoints<br />• Write executive summary highlighting top 3-5 critical findings<br />• Include supporting data/screenshots for each finding<br />• Document quick wins (low effort, high impact fixes)<br />• Format document using LeanScale brand template |
| 10. Build Prioritized Roadmap | 1h | Translate findings into a sequenced action plan with recommended projects. End state: Roadmap document showing what to fix, in what order, with estimated effort.<br /><br />• Group related findings into logical project clusters<br />• Prioritize based on impact (revenue potential) and effort (hours/complexity)<br />• Sequence projects considering dependencies (e.g., data quality before advanced reporting)<br />• Estimate hours for each recommended project<br />• Map projects to LeanScale service offerings where applicable<br />• Create visual roadmap (quarters or 30/60/90 day view) |
| 11. Conduct Results Walkthrough | 1h | Present findings, scorecard, and roadmap to client stakeholders in live session.
