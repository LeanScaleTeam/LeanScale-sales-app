**Hours:** 35h

### Task List: (Market Map) 1. Assessment & Alignment
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Audit Existing Customer Data and Win Patterns | 2.5h | Analyze closed-won deal data to identify patterns among top-performing customers and establish a data-driven foundation for ICP criteria. End state: Clear understanding of what attributes correlate with successful deals.<br /><br />• Pull closed-won deal data from CRM for last 12-24 months (minimum 50 deals, ideally 100+)<br />• Identify top 20% of customers by ACV, retention rate, and sales cycle length<br />• Document common firmographic attributes (industry, employee count, revenue range, geography)<br />• Identify technographic patterns (tech stack, tools used, infrastructure)<br />• Note behavioral signals present at time of close (funding events, hiring patterns, growth signals)<br />• Compare actual closed-won patterns against any existing ICP documentation to identify gaps |

End state: Documented tier definitions with score ranges and qualitative descriptions.<br /><br />• Define Tier 1 threshold (e.g., ICP score 80+) representing highest-fit accounts<br />• Define Tier 2 threshold (e.g., ICP score 50-79) representing good-fit accounts<br />• Define Tier 3 threshold (e.g., ICP score below 50) representing nurture-only accounts<br />• Create qualitative descriptions for each tier (e.g., Tier 1 = "Looks exactly like our top 20% customers")<br />• Determine if any attributes are automatic qualifiers or disqualifiers regardless of score<br />• Validate tier definitions against 10-20 known accounts to test accuracy |
| 5. Scope TAM Geography and Segments | 1h | Define the geographic and segment boundaries for the market map to ensure enrichment efforts are focused and manageable. End state: Clear scope document with geographic limits and segment definitions.<br /><br />• Confirm geographic scope with stakeholders (US-only, North America, global, specific regions)<br />• Define industry/vertical scope (all industries vs. specific verticals)<br />• Determine company size ranges to include (SMB, mid-market, enterprise, or specific ranges)<br />• Identify any explicit exclusions (competitors, existing customers, specific industries)<br />• Estimate total account volume based on scope to inform tool selection and budget<br />• Document scope decisions for future reference and maintenance |
| 6. Conduct Stakeholder Alignment Session | 1.5h | Present ICP rubric and tier definitions to key stakeholders for validation and buy-in before building the market map. End state: Approved ICP Fit Scoring Rubric and tier model signed off by leadership.<br /><br />• Schedule 60-minute alignment session with VP Marketing, VP Sales, and RevOps lead<br />• Present closed-won analysis findings and proposed ICP attributes<br />• Walk through tier definitions with example accounts from each tier<br />• Address concerns and incorporate feedback into rubric<br />• Get explicit sign-off on rubric and tier definitions before proceeding<br />• Document any adjustments made during session and update rubric accordingly |
