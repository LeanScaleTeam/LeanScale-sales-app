### Task List: (Conversation Intelligence) 1. Discovery & Procurement
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|

| 6. Complete Procurement and Contracts | 2.5h | Finalize vendor selection, negotiate contract terms, and complete procurement. End state: Contract signed with clear terms on implementation support, SLAs, and pricing.<br /><br />• Negotiate contract terms (term length - avoid multi-year if uncertain, user minimums, price locks)<br />• Review security/compliance documentation with IT and Legal<br />• Clarify implementation support included vs additional cost<br />• Document SLAs for uptime, support response, and data processing times<br />• Complete procurement approval process<br />• Obtain signed contract and implementation kickoff date |
