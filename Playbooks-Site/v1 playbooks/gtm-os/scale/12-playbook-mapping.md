## Playbook Mapping: Scale Stage

### Essential (Do These)

| Playbook | Why Now |
|----------|---------|
| **Growth Model** | Forecasting and pipeline math become critical |
| **Lead Lifecycle** | Volume requires clear lead management |
| **Sales Lifecycle** | Stage gates and forecasting require this |
| **Customer Lifecycle** | Health scoring and renewal process need it |
| **GTM Lifecycle** | End-to-end visibility matters at scale |
| **Sales Territory Design** | Multiple reps require territory structure |
| **Sales Qualification Methodology** | Consistent qualification across team |
| **Executive Reporting Suite** | Leadership needs unified reporting |
| **Forecasting Model** | Forecast accuracy requires methodology |
| **Quotas and Target Setting** | Team quotas require structure |
| **Sales Engagement Platform** | Rep productivity at scale |
| **Conversation Intelligence** | Coaching and deal visibility |

### Recommended (If Time/Budget)

| Playbook | Why Consider |
|----------|--------------|
| **ABM/ABS Process** | If enterprise segment exists |
| **Marketing Automation Implementation** | If upgrading MAP |
| **Customer Success Platform** | If customer count warrants |
| **Sales Enablement Platform** | If onboarding/enablement is challenge |
| **Renewal Process** | Formalize if not already |
| **Physical Event Process** | If events are major channel |
| **Lead and Opportunity Attribution** | If attribution is pain point |

### Premature (Avoid For Now)

| Playbook | Why Wait |
|----------|----------|
| **CPQ Implementation** | Deal complexity doesn't justify (usually) |
| **Partner Portal** | Channel program not mature enough |
| **Advanced RevOps Modeling** | Data maturity not sufficient |
| **Multi-Region Setup** | Geographic expansion typically later |

## What to Skip at Scale Stage

These aren't worth the investment yet — organizations at this stage should focus on building scalable infrastructure, not optimizing what doesn't exist:

- **CPQ (Configure-Price-Quote)** — deal complexity doesn't justify; structured pricing works
- **Advanced partner programs** — channel programs need partner ops; start conversations, not programs
- **Multi-region GTM** — geographic expansion is typically Optimize/Platform territory
- **Segment-specific unit economics** — segments not stable enough for meaningful LTV:CAC
- **Advanced compensation models** — keep comp plans understandable; complexity is Optimize territory
- **Full ABM infrastructure** — consider 1:Few ABM, not 1:1 with dedicated resources
- **Enterprise CS platforms** — if under 100 customers or under 3 CSMs, simpler tools work
- **Predictive analytics** — not enough historical data for meaningful prediction
