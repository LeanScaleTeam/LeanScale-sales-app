## Overview

This is a transcript from a RevOps expert interview featuring Anthony (CEO of LeanScale) and a Vasco representative discussing how to build growth plans that boards will support and that align teams around shared objectives.

## Key Sections

### The Planning Problem

Traditional planning seasons are lengthy and problematic. Companies typically:
- Start with arbitrary macro goals from leadership
- Create multiple spreadsheet versions through iterations
- Experience misalignment between departments
- Approve plans in February/March that are "already obsolete"

### Core Framework: Building the Growth Model

#### 1. Anchoring on ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)

The north star metric for SaaS companies. Key components include:

- Current ARR baseline
- New ARR (new customer logos)
- Expansion revenue (upsells within existing customers)
- Churn and contraction losses
- Net retention rate

> "Take a look at existing customer base. How much do you anticipate this cohort to expand throughout the year?"

#### 2. Two-Part Planning Approach

**Top-Down Reverse Engineering:**
- Start with board's growth target (2x, 3x ARR)
- Work backward to determine required inputs
- Deduce necessary pipeline, conversion rates, and team size

**Bottom-Up Staffing:**
- Calculate people and capabilities needed
- Account for sales reps, CS teams, SEs
- Factor in ramp times

#### 3. Critical Funnel Metrics

- SQL-to-close conversion rate (20-40% benchmark depending on deal size)
- Sales cycle length
- MQL-to-SQL conversion
- Average contract value (ACV)

### The Sales Cycle Trap

One of the most common planning errors: underestimating how sales cycle length impacts pipeline requirements.

> "Nothing absolutely nothing trips up a growth model more than factoring in your sales cycle."

**Example:** If you need to close deals in Q3 but have a 2-quarter sales cycle, pipeline must be built in Q1—not Q2.

### Staffing and Ramp Time

Sales ramp time should never be shorter than your sales cycle. A fully ramped rep closes deals and generates consistent pipeline—not just completing training.

### Unit Economics Framework

Why boards focus here: investors evaluate whether growth is sustainable and scalable, not just aggressive topline targets.

**Key metrics tracked:**
- Net growth rate
- Lifetime value (LTV)
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- CAC payback period
- Net revenue retention (NRR)
- Gross revenue retention (GRR)
- Revenue per employee
- "Magic number" (new ARR per dollar spent on S&M)

### Series A Readiness Example

Reaching $2M ARR milestone requires:
- Growth rate above 100%
- CAC payback within 18 months
- Gross revenue retention around 85%

### The Benchmarking Advantage

Use published VC/PE benchmarks to stress-test assumptions and depersonalize conversations:

> "Benchmarks are amazing at depersonalizing the conversation between you and the person but putting it to what the market says."

Resources mentioned: Inside Partner periodic table and Vasco's compiled benchmark spreadsheet.

### Scenario Modeling and Live Reporting

Move beyond static spreadsheets:

- Build multiple scenarios to test sensitivity
- Create live dashboards showing progress-to-target
- Implement daily "sales tracker" emails
- Split tracking between core business and new bets

**Forcing function result:** Daily progress emails achieve 85% open rates, creating gravitational pull toward a single data source.

### Core vs. New Bets Separation

When pursuing new markets or segments, track separately from core business. This prevents board confusion when new initiatives naturally show:
- Lower conversion rates
- Longer sales cycles
- Different unit economics

### The 1% Improvement Mentality

> "There are no silver bullets...it's all the little improvement that compound every day that have a manifesting impact."

Consistent small improvements across messaging, demo quality, and coverage compound to achieve seemingly impossible targets like 3x growth.

## Practical Application

**When presenting plans to executive teams, focus the conversation on inputs:**
- Which metrics are incorrect?
- Where can performance improve?
- Should we adjust conversion, cycle length, or MQL-SQL conversion?

**Don't debate outputs—debate inputs.**

## Conclusion

RevOps exists to make growth "predictable, fast and efficient" through:
- Credible models grounded in data
- Transparent unit economics
- Live operating rhythms
- Board-ready visibility

Building this infrastructure creates trust with investors and boards, which materially impacts valuation and exit outcomes.
