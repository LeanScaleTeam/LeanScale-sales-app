# Growth Model Overview

Financial Modeling & ARR Target Operationalization

## 1. Project Overview

### What is Growth Model?

**Definition:** A financial modeling project that integrates top-down ARR targets with bottom-up GTM efficiency metrics (the Power 10) to create achievable quarterly revenue goals. The output identifies specific gaps—which conversion rates, volume metrics, or efficiency metrics need improvement to hit targets. The model breaks ARR into its core components: New ARR, Expansion ARR, Contraction ARR, and Churned ARR to show which motion drives results.

**What it is NOT:** Not a quota-setting exercise (that's a downstream project). Not a CRM implementation or data cleanup. Not a sales process redesign. Not a comp plan design. Not a one-time deliverable—the model must be maintainable and updated monthly by the client.

### What Growth Model Unlocks

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Arbitrary targets with no line of sight | Bottoms-up forecast with specific requirements |
| Flying blind on gaps | Quantified gaps with dollar impact |
| Gut-feel resource allocation | Data-backed capacity planning |
| "Growth at any cost" | Efficient growth demonstrable to board |
| Quarterly surprises | Scenario-based planning with early warning |

**What you get:**
- Quarterly roadmap showing exactly which metrics are off-benchmark
- Where capacity gaps exist and what investment is needed
- Leadership can prioritize with confidence
- Model validated against external benchmarks (KeyBanc, OpenView)
- Scenario planning (base case, upside, conservative)
- Monthly ARR momentum tracking foundation

### ICP Value Proposition

**Pain it solves:** Leadership has a board-mandated ARR target but no clear line of sight into what operational metrics need to change to hit it. They're flying blind—targets feel arbitrary, gaps are unclear, and resource allocation is based on gut feel. In 2025's environment, VCs and boards demand proof of efficient growth (not growth at any cost), and clients lack the framework to demonstrate monetization and retention alongside growth.

**Outcome delivered:** A quarterly roadmap showing exactly which metrics are off-benchmark, where capacity gaps exist, and what investment (reps, pipeline, leads) is needed to hit targets. Leadership can now prioritize with confidence and validate their plan against external benchmarks (KeyBanc, OpenView). The model enables scenario planning (base case, upside, conservative) and feeds into monthly ARR momentum tracking.

### Who Owns It

**Typically the CRO, VP Sales, or Head of RevOps** on the client side. Finance/FP&A as secondary stakeholder.

**Key Stakeholders:**
- **CRO / VP Sales** - Executive sponsor, owns ARR targets
- **Head of RevOps** - Technical owner, maintains model post-project
- **Finance / FP&A** - Validates assumptions, aligns with financial forecasts
- **Sales Leadership** - Validates capacity and productivity assumptions

### Business Outcomes

**Primary Outcomes:**
- Clear line of sight from top-down targets to bottom-up requirements
- Quantified gaps with prioritized improvement areas
- Data-backed resource allocation decisions
- Board-ready planning with scenario analysis
- Monthly ARR momentum tracking capability

**Secondary Outcomes:**
- Alignment between sales, marketing, and finance on targets
- Foundation for quota-setting and territory design
- Early warning system for pipeline shortfalls
- Benchmark comparison for investor conversations

### The Power 10 Metrics Framework

The Growth Model is built on the **Power 10** — the 7-10 key efficiency metrics that create 80% of impact:

**Volume Metrics:**
- Leads Generated
- Pipeline Created
- Opportunities Created

**Conversion Metrics:**
- MQL → SQL Conversion Rate
- SQL → Opportunity Rate
- Win Rate

**Efficiency Metrics:**
- Sales Cycle Length
- Average Contract Value (ACV)
- Rep Productivity (ARR per Rep)

**Retention Metrics:**
- Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
- Gross Revenue Retention
- Expansion Rate

### The Data Behind the Problem

Growth modeling is critical because the SaaS environment has fundamentally shifted:

**The 2025 Reality:**
- **77% of sellers missed quota in 2025** — even after companies cut quotas by 13%
- **VCs demand efficient growth** — Rule of 40 and Magic Number are table stakes for funding conversations
- **Pipeline coverage has declined** — average coverage dropped from 4x to 2.8x as deals elongate
- **Churn is the silent killer** — 1% increase in churn can cost 12% of company value over 5 years

**The cost of flying blind:**
- Quotas set arbitrarily lead to missed targets and demoralized reps
- Hiring plans disconnected from pipeline reality waste runway
- Board conversations lack credibility without bottoms-up validation
- Late detection of gaps leaves no time for course correction

### Pain Points This Project Solves

| Pain Point | What Growth Model Enables |
|------------|--------------------------|
| "We'll hit our number, trust us" | Bottoms-up math showing exactly what must be true |
| Arbitrary hiring plans | Capacity model tied to required productivity |
| No idea which metrics to fix | Quantified gap analysis with dollar impact |
| Pipeline surprises | Scenario planning with early warning triggers |
| Board asks questions we can't answer | External benchmark validation |
| Sales/marketing finger-pointing on targets | Shared model with agreed inputs |

### ARR Components: Where Growth Comes From

The model breaks ARR into four components to show which motion is driving (or dragging) results:

| Component | Definition | Healthy Range |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **New ARR** | Revenue from net-new customers | Varies by stage |
| **Expansion ARR** | Revenue from existing customer upsells | 20-40% of new ARR |
| **Contraction ARR** | Revenue lost to downgrades | Less than 5% of base |
| **Churned ARR** | Revenue lost to customer exits | Less than 10% annually (varies) |

**Net Revenue Retention (NRR)** = (Starting ARR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / Starting ARR

**Benchmark NRR by ACV:**
- SMB (under $10k ACV): 90-100%
- Mid-Market ($10k-$100k): 100-110%
- Enterprise (over $100k): 110-130%
