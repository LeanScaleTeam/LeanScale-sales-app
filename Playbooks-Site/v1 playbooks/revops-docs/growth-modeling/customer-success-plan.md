# Customer Success Plan

Customer success is a vital part of any business, and for startups, it's even more critical. A solid customer success plan can help you keep your customers, grow your revenue, and expand your business.

## 1. Customer Segmentation

Divide customers into groups for personalized strategies. Common segmentation criteria include:

- **Company size** - Enterprise, mid-market, SMB
- **Industry** - Vertical-specific needs and challenges
- **Product usage** - Feature adoption and engagement levels
- **Customer lifecycle stage** - Onboarding, growth, renewal

## 2. Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

Define expected service levels with clear metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Uptime** | System availability percentage |
| **Response Time** | Initial response to support requests |
| **Resolution Time** | Time to fully resolve issues |
| **Customer Satisfaction** | CSAT or NPS scores |

## 3. Customer Health Scores

Customer health scores are a tool for measuring relationship strength. Build scores based on:

- **Customer satisfaction** - Survey responses and feedback
- **Product usage** - Login frequency, feature adoption
- **Churn indicators** - Declining engagement, support escalations

Health scores help identify at-risk customers for proactive retention efforts.

## 4. Onboarding and Training

Help customers start quickly and use products effectively:

- **Structured onboarding programs** - Step-by-step implementation
- **Training resources** - Documentation, videos, webinars
- **Milestone tracking** - Time-to-value metrics

Tailor onboarding to specific customer needs and complexity levels.

## 5. Customer Feedback

Collect feedback through multiple channels:

- **Surveys** - NPS, CSAT, product feedback
- **Interviews** - In-depth customer conversations
- **Focus groups** - Collaborative feedback sessions
- **Social media** - Public sentiment monitoring

Use feedback to drive product improvements and support enhancements.

## 6. Customer Success Metrics

Track effectiveness with key metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)** | Direct satisfaction measurement |
| **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** | Likelihood to recommend |
| **Customer Retention Rate** | Percentage of customers retained |
| **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** | Total revenue from a customer |
| **Net Revenue Retention (NRR)** | Revenue retention including expansion |

## Actionable Tips

- **Engage customers** in plan development for better alignment
