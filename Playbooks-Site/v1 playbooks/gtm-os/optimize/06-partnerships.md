## Partnerships

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Partnerships become strategic at Optimize. Channel programs become formal. Technology partnerships deepen. Partner operations becomes a real function. Partner-sourced revenue becomes meaningful.

## Partnership Types at Optimize

| Type | Maturity | Investment |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Technology partnerships** | Mature — deep integrations, co-selling | Active partner management |
| **Channel partnerships** | Active programs — formal structure | Partner ops, MDF, enablement |
| **Strategic partnerships** | Select relationships — joint value creation | Executive sponsorship |
| **Ecosystem partnerships** | Early — marketplace, community | Platform strategy consideration |

## Channel Program Structure

| Element | What It Looks Like |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Partner tiers** | 2-3 tiers with clear requirements and benefits |
| **Partner enablement** | Training, certification, sales resources |
| **Partner portal** | Self-serve access to materials, deal registration |
| **MDF program** | Structured co-marketing investment |
| **Deal registration** | Protection and incentives for partner-sourced deals |
| **Partner operations** | Dedicated resource(s) managing programs |

## Partnership Metrics at Optimize

| Metric | Target | Signal |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Partner-sourced revenue** | 10-20% of new business | Channel health |

## Partnership Infrastructure

| Component | What's Needed |
|-----------|--------------|
| **PRM (Partner Relationship Management)** | Consider — depends on partner count |

| **Partner enablement** | Training, certification, playbooks |
| **Deal registration** | CRM integration, protection rules |
| **Partner success** | Onboarding, QBRs, health tracking |

**What NOT to do:**
- **Channel without enablement** — partners can't sell what they don't understand
- **Too many partners** — quality over quantity
- **No partner accountability** — measure and manage performance
- **Ignoring partner conflicts** — clear rules of engagement
