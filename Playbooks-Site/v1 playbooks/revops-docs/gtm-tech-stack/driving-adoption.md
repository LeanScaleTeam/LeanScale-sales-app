# Driving System Adoption

Successful technology adoption requires careful planning and stakeholder engagement. This guide outlines the key steps for driving system adoption across your organization.

## Process Before Technology

- **Step 1:** Prioritize process definition and documentation before evaluating technology
- **Step 2:** Evaluate tools' potential to empower existing processes rather than drive change
- **Step 3:** Select best-fit technology that aligns with your defined process

## Stakeholder Alignment

- **Step 4:** Engage all relevant stakeholders across different teams to gather comprehensive perspectives
- **Step 5:** Seek insights from unique roles that will interact with the technology
- **Step 6:** Foster informed decision-making by incorporating diverse viewpoints

## Enablement and Training

- **Step 7:** Develop enablement materials and training programs post-decision
- **Step 8:** Establish forums for users to interact and engage with the technology
- **Step 9:** Provide continuous training after deployment to ensure sustained proficiency
