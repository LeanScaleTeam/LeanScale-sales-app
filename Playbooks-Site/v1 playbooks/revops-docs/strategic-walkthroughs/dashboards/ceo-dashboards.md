# CEO Dashboards

This dashboard resource provides B2B SaaS companies with key performance indicators for business monitoring. The guide covers five critical metrics that every CEO should track.

## Key Metrics Overview

- **ARR** (Annual Recurring Revenue)
- **New Business Bookings**
- **SQLs** (Sales Qualified Leads) or Created Pipeline
- **Funnel Efficiency** (Sales Qualified Lead to Closed Won)
- **Churn Rate**

## ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)

ARR represents the total amount of recurring revenue that the company generates each year, calculated by multiplying customer count by average revenue per customer.

**Key considerations:**

- Serves as the primary valuation driver for SaaS companies
- Should function as the organization's north-star KPI
- Track net ARR changes across new business, expansion, contraction, and churn
- Net change in ARR is the most important growth measurement

## New Business Bookings

These are newly signed contracts each month and represent the primary growth driver for SaaS businesses.

**Key considerations:**

- Requires close monitoring to ensure growth targets are met
- Can be segmented by sales representative, marketing channel, or lead source
- Understanding which reps and channels generate the most value is essential

## SQLs or Created Pipeline

This metric counts leads qualified by the sales team as potential customers, serving as a leading indicator for future bookings.

**Key considerations:**

- Requires close tracking for meeting growth objectives
- Can be segmented by marketing channel or lead source
- Identifying top-performing channels and sources drives efficiency

## Funnel Efficiency

This measures the percentage of sales qualified leads that turn into closed won deals, indicating sales process effectiveness.

**Key considerations:**

- Requires close monitoring to verify efficient lead conversion
- Optimization strategies include improving the sales process, reducing sales cycles, and enhancing lead quality

## Churn Rate

This represents the percentage of customers who cancel their subscriptions each month, a critical metric impacting growth trajectory.

**Key considerations:**

- Requires close monitoring to prevent unsustainable customer loss
- Can be reduced through improved customer experience, excellent support, and competitive pricing

## Conclusion

By tracking these metrics, companies can identify trends, make informed decisions, and work toward achieving growth objectives.
