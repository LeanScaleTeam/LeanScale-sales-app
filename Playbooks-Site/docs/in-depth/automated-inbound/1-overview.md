# Automated Inbound Overview

Lead Enrichment, Routing & Speed-to-Lead Automation

## 1. Project Overview

### What is Automated Inbound?

**Definition:** A project that automates the enrichment, scoring, routing, and follow-up of inbound leads using Clay and CRM workflows. The deliverable is a working pipeline where leads are instantly enriched, tiered, routed to the right rep or sequence, and actioned—whether that's human follow-up, automated response, or calendar booking.

**The core transformation:** Your inbound leads go from sitting in a queue waiting for manual triage to being instantly enriched, scored, routed, and actioned—whether that's a human follow-up, automated sequence, or Calendly booking.

**What it is NOT:** Not a data cleansing/deduplication project. Not a lead scoring model build (that uses enriched data but is separate scope). Not a market mapping/ICP exercise (that defines target criteria, though it integrates well with Market Map). Not copywriting services (structure provided, client writes messaging).

### What Automated Inbound Unlocks

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Leads sit in queue until rep reviews | Instant enrichment + routing on form fill |
| Same follow-up for all leads | Tier-based response (T1 gets white glove) |
| Off-hours leads wait until morning | Automated response within minutes |
| Manual research before outreach | Enrichment data already in CRM |
| "Speed to lead" is aspirational | Measurable, automated speed-to-lead |

**What you get:**
- Instant lead enrichment on form fill (no manual research)
- Credit-efficient enrichment—check if account already exists before spending credits (Market Map integration)
- Tier-based routing (T1 accounts get priority treatment)
- Automated follow-up sequences for off-hours leads
- Speed-to-lead optimization (critical for high-intent signals)
- Intelligent decision trees (human vs automated based on timing/tier)

### Clay Use Case Pyramid Position

Automated Inbound builds on top of Market Map. When Market Map exists, the automated inbound flow can check if a lead is at a T1 account before spending credits on enrichment.

**Why Market Map + Automated Inbound is powerful:**
- If account exists in Market Map → skip account-level enrichment, just enrich contact
- Tier data already available → routing can happen instantly
- Credit savings → only spend on what's missing
- Faster processing → less waiting for enrichment to complete

### ICP Value Proposition

**Pain it solves:** Marketing and sales teams receive inbound leads with minimal information (name, email, company) forcing SDRs to spend 10-15 minutes manually researching each lead before outreach. This delays speed-to-lead, creates inconsistent data quality, and wastes selling time on research.

**Outcome delivered:** Every inbound lead is automatically enriched with 15-25 data points (company size, industry, tech stack, job title, direct dial, funding, etc.) within seconds of form submission. SDRs can immediately prioritize and personalize outreach. Lead scoring and routing operate on complete data.

**Who owns it:** VP of Marketing Operations or RevOps Leader (with input from Demand Gen and Sales Development leadership).

### Business Outcomes

#### Primary Outcomes

| Outcome | Quantified Impact |
|---------|-------------------|
| Faster speed-to-lead | Leads contacted within 5 minutes are 21x more likely to qualify vs 30-minute delay |
| Higher conversion on inbound | Companies using automated routing see 17-23% improvement in inbound conversion rates |
| Reduced manual triage | Sales reps currently spend only 28-30% of their time selling; automation reclaims admin hours |
| Consistent off-hours follow-up | Automated sequences fire regardless of time, capturing the 78% of buyers who go with first responder |
| Better lead routing | Tier-based routing prioritizes high-value leads; intelligent routing improves close rates by 20% |

#### Secondary Outcomes

- Foundation for MQL automation workflows
- Data visibility on inbound lead quality
- Clay credit efficiency (enrich only what matters)
- Proof of data for reps (hyperlinked context for faster research)

### The Data Behind the Problem

The speed-to-lead problem is backed by extensive research:

#### The 5-Minute Window

- Businesses that respond in 5 minutes or less are **100x more likely** to connect and convert
- Contacting a lead within 5 minutes makes you **21x more likely** to qualify them vs waiting 30 minutes
- After 5 minutes, the chance of qualifying a lead **drops by 80%**
- Responding within 60 seconds increases conversions by **391%**

#### The Reality Gap

- Average B2B response time: **42-47 hours**
- **63% of B2B companies** don't respond to inbound leads at all
- Only **1% of B2B companies** respond in under 5 minutes
- Only **4.7% of companies** achieve the optimal 5-minute window

#### First Responder Advantage

- **78% of B2B customers** buy from the vendor who responds first
- **35-50% of sales** go to the first responder
- Companies responding within 1 hour are **7x more likely** to have meaningful conversations with decision-makers

#### The Admin Tax

- Sales reps spend **only 28-30%** of their time actually selling
- **70% of rep time** goes to non-selling tasks like admin and meeting prep
- **67% of sales reps** don't expect to meet quota; **84% missed it** last year

### Pain Points Solved

| Pain Point | What Automated Inbound Enables | Industry Data |
|------------|-------------------------------|---------------|
| Leads wait hours/days for follow-up | Instant enrichment + automated or routed response | Average B2B response time is 42-47 hours. 63% of companies never respond at all |
| Off-hours leads fall through cracks | Automated sequences fire regardless of time | Just 1% of B2B companies respond in under 5 minutes |
| Reps spend time on wrong leads | Tier-based routing prioritizes high-value leads | Sales reps spend only 28% of their week actually selling |
| No context when following up | Enrichment data + proof hyperlinks in notification | 87% of marketing databases are underutilized with missing firmographics |
| Inconsistent follow-up process | Systematic decision tree for all scenarios | Companies using multiple lead distribution systems boost conversion by 107% |
| MQL definition not operationalized | Automation triggers based on MQL criteria | Organizations using lead scoring see 77% increase in lead generation ROI |
