## PLG vs SLG Considerations

Product-led growth (PLG) and sales-led growth (SLG) motions differ meaningfully as companies scale. Here's how the GTM OS guidance varies by motion:

### Build Stage
**Usually the same** — Founder-led regardless of motion. PLG companies still need founder involvement to understand activation patterns. SLG companies are doing founder-led sales. Both are hypothesis-testing.

### Stabilize Stage
**Divergence begins:**

| Dimension | PLG | SLG |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| **First hire** | Growth/product engineer | SDR or AE |
| **Key metric** | Activation rate, time-to-value | Pipeline, quota attainment |
| **Process focus** | Onboarding optimization | Sales process documentation |
| **Tech stack** | Analytics, product usage tools | CRM, sales engagement |

### Scale Stage
**Significant differences:**

| Dimension | PLG | SLG |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| **Team structure** | Growth team, PLG SDRs for expansion | Traditional sales hierarchy |
| **Lead scoring** | Product usage signals | Behavioral + firmographic |
| **Territory design** | Account-based expansion pods | Geographic or segment-based |
| **Key playbooks** | PLG GTM Design, Lead Scoring (PLG) | Sales Territory Design, Forecasting |
| **NRR expectation** | 120%+ (expansion-heavy) | 105-110% |

### Optimize Stage
**Convergence with specialization:**

| Dimension | PLG | SLG |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| **Motion** | PLG + Sales Assist for enterprise | SLG + self-serve for SMB |
| **Segment approach** | Usage-based segments | ACV-based segments |
| **Efficiency focus** | CAC optimization via product | CAC optimization via process |

### Platform Stage
**Most companies have hybrid motions** — PLG for volume/SMB, SLG for enterprise. The distinction matters less than segment-specific execution.

**How to use this guidance:** If your company is clearly PLG or SLG, apply the relevant lens to each stage's guidance. Most companies at Scale+ are hybrid — use both perspectives.
