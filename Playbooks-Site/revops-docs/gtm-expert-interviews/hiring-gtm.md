## Overview

This interview features Theo Pavlich, Director of Go-to-Market Operations at ADA, discussing RevOps hiring strategies during rapid scaling. The conversation emphasizes unconventional backgrounds and adaptability over rigid credential requirements.

## Core Hiring Philosophy

**Key Principle: Prioritize Curiosity**

Theo advocates that "curiosity" represents the defining trait when evaluating candidates. Rather than requiring specific tool expertise, successful hires demonstrate hunger to learn RevOps, technology, and systems thinking.

### Why Unconventional Backgrounds Matter

Theo's own path illustrates this philosophy—working in theater for twelve years before transitioning to marketing operations. The speaker argues that diverse experiences develop transferable skills:

- Systems thinking and process optimization
- Problem-solving under constraints
- Resilience and adaptability

## Hard Skills Assessment

**Entry-Level Positions:**
- No single non-negotiable hard skill requirement
- Basic tech literacy and ability to use remote collaboration tools expected
- Evidence of tool exploration or self-taught technical skills valued

**Senior Roles:**
- Familiarity with CRM, marketing automation, sales engagement platforms helpful
- Critical: willingness to learn new tools rather than rigid specialization
- Adaptability matters more than tool mastery

### The Tool Landscape Reality

The marketing technology ecosystem contains "over 15,000 tools" across categories, with approximately "three new tools added daily." This volume makes tool-specific expertise less valuable than landscape awareness and learning agility.

## Interview Questions and Assessment Tactics

**For Early-Career Specialists:**

1. Describe unconventional tool usage—reveals resourcefulness and problem-solving creativity
2. Walk through troubleshooting process—demonstrates thinking methodology and collaboration approach
3. Share willingness to experiment with limited budgets

**For Experienced/Manager-Level Candidates:**

1. What RevOps project haven't you attempted but find compelling?
2. Which untested tools interest you?—indicates market awareness and intellectual curiosity
3. Describe pivoting away from wrong tool choices—assesses humility and decision-making

**Practical Testing Methods:**

LeanScale uses low-stakes assignments—providing access to no-code platforms (Webflow, Bolt) to build GTM products within timeboxed sessions. This reveals creativity, learning speed, and genuine interest without requiring free work.

## Key Qualities in Ideal Candidates

| Quality | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| **Curiosity** | Drives continuous learning across tool changes |
| **Adaptability** | Navigates rapid GTM shifts and market changes |
| **Systems Thinking** | Ensures end-to-end efficiency and usability |
| **Humility** | Enables learning from mistakes and requesting support |
| **Cross-functional Empathy** | Builds tools serving sales, marketing, and customer success |

## Avoiding Common Hiring Mistakes

**Don't require:**
- Perfect resume trajectories without gaps
- Exact prior experience at similar companies
- Specific tool certifications as dealbreakers

**Do look for:**
- Evidence of problem-solving across contexts
- Comfort admitting knowledge gaps
- Proactive tool exploration or side projects

## Candidate Background Examples

Theo references diverse paths leading to RevOps success:
- Seventh-grade Excel class foundation
- Website building for theater artists
- MySpace HTML learning
- Social media presence demonstrating technical humor and engagement

These unconventional routes developed the analytical and creative capacities essential for modern operations roles.

## Tool Strategy and Organizational Debt

**Preventing "Tool Creep":**

When evaluating candidates, assess whether they optimize with existing tools before purchasing new solutions. Series A/B companies average 30+ go-to-market tools—many overlapping—creating cognitive and financial burden.

Red flags: candidates immediately proposing new platforms without exploring current system capabilities.

Green flags: candidates asking "what can we do with what we have?" before justifying additional spending.

## Theater Industry Lessons

Theo emphasizes how theater training developed professional resilience:

- **Notes sessions**: Directors provide constructive feedback on performance failures, building thick skin
- **Resourcefulness**: Creating solutions from minimal materials ("make a set from a lightbulb, extension cable, and three strings")
- **Collaboration**: Theater requires teamwork for executing complex productions

## The Hiring Paradox

Despite 63% of B2B companies establishing RevOps functions, talent scarcity persists. The solution involves broadening search criteria beyond traditional profiles and implementing rigorous (but creative) assessment methods that reveal adaptability and problem-solving capacity.
