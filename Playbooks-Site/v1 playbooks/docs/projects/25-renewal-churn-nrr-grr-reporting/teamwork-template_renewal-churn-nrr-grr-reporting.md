## Milestone: Renewal, Churn, NRR/GRR Reporting
**Description:** A data infrastructure and reporting project that establishes the definitions, data models, dashboards, and processes to accurately track customer retention metrics including renewals, churn, Net Revenue Retention (NRR), and Gross Revenue Retention (GRR).

### Task List: (Renewal Churn Reporting) 1. Discovery & Data Model
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Audit Current Retention Tracking | 2.5h | Assess how renewals, churn, and retention metrics are currently tracked (if at all) across the organization. End state: Gap analysis documenting what exists, what's missing, and where data lives.<br /><br />• Interview CS leadership on how they currently track renewals and churn<br />• Review existing dashboards and reports for retention metrics<br />• Identify all data sources: CRM (Salesforce/HubSpot), billing system, CS platform (Gainsight/ChurnZero/Vitally)<br />• Document current definitions being used (are they consistent across teams?)<br />• Assess data quality: subscription start/end dates, contract values, renewal dates<br />• Quantify the gap (e.g., "Finance says 92% GRR, CS says 88%") |
| 2. Establish Metric Definitions | 2.5h | Define clear, company-wide definitions for renewal, churn, NRR, and GRR that align with industry standards and finance requirements. End state: Documented metric definitions approved by CS, Finance, and leadership.<br /><br />• Define GRR formula: (Starting MRR - Contraction - Churn) / Starting MRR<br />• Define NRR formula: (Starting MRR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / Starting MRR<br />• Define churn types: voluntary vs involuntary, customer churn vs revenue churn<br />• Establish measurement period (monthly, quarterly, annual cohorts)<br />• Determine treatment of edge cases: mid-contract downgrades, early renewals, multi-year contracts<br />• Get sign-off from Finance and CS leadership on definitions<br />• Document in a Retention Metrics Definition Guide |
| 3. Map Data Sources and Requirements | 2h | Create a data architecture map showing where each data element lives and how it flows into retention calculations. End state: Data requirements document specifying source systems, fields, and integration needs.<br /><br />• Map subscription/contract data location (CRM opportunity records, billing system)<br />• Map expansion/contraction data (upsell opportunities, pricing changes)<br />• Map churn event data (cancellation records, non-renewal flags)<br />• Identify data gaps (missing renewal dates, incomplete contract values)<br />• Document required integrations between systems<br />• Define data refresh frequency requirements (real-time vs daily vs monthly) |
| 4. Build Subscription Data Model | 3.5h | Create or enhance the data structures needed to track subscription lifecycle including start/end dates, renewals, expansions, and churn events. End state: Data model implemented in CRM with proper object relationships.<br /><br />• Design subscription/contract object structure (if not using existing)<br />• Define required fields: contract start date, contract end date, contract value, renewal date, renewal owner<br />• Create fields for tracking: expansion ARR, contraction ARR, churn reason, churn date<br />• Establish relationships: Account → Contracts → Renewal Opportunities<br />• Configure record types or picklists for contract status (active, renewed, churned, downgraded)<br />• Set up auto-calculation fields for ARR and MRR if needed |
| 5. Configure Renewal Pipeline | 3.5h | Set up the renewal opportunity workflow in the CRM to track upcoming renewals as a pipeline. End state: Renewal opportunities automatically created and staged for each account approaching renewal.<br /><br />• Create renewal opportunity record type or stage values<br />• Configure automation to create renewal opportunities 90-120 days before contract end<br />• Set up renewal amount calculation (prior contract value as baseline)<br />• Define renewal stages: Upcoming, In Progress, Committed, Closed Won, Closed Lost<br />• Configure probability percentages for each stage<br />• Set up renewal owner assignment rules (CSM or Account Manager)<br />• Test automation with sample records |
| 6. Implement Churn Tracking | 3h | Configure the system to capture and categorize churn events with proper reason coding. End state: Churn events captured with reason codes and linked to the correct account/contract.<br /><br />• Create churn reason picklist (competitive loss, budget cut, poor fit, product gaps, etc.)<br />• Configure churn event capture (Closed Lost renewal, contract termination)<br />• Set up voluntary vs involuntary churn categorization<br />• Build automation to flag churned accounts and update account status<br />• Configure churn date capture (effective date vs decision date)<br />• Test churn recording workflow with sample scenarios |

### Task List: (Renewal Churn Reporting) 2. Reporting & Handoff
**Contains:** Parts 3-4

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 7. Build Core Retention Reports | 3.5h | Create the foundational reports that calculate GRR, NRR, and renewal rates using the defined formulas. End state: Core retention reports showing accurate metrics that match agreed-upon definitions.<br /><br />• Build monthly GRR calculation report (cohort-based)<br />• Build monthly NRR calculation report including expansion<br />• Create renewal rate report (won renewals / total renewals due)<br />• Build churn analysis report by reason, segment, and time period<br />• Create ARR movement report (starting ARR, new, expansion, contraction, churn, ending ARR)<br />• Validate calculations with Finance using historical data |
| 8. Develop Executive Dashboard | 4h | Create a leadership dashboard providing at-a-glance visibility into retention health and trends. End state: Executive dashboard deployed showing key retention KPIs with trend lines.<br /><br />• Design dashboard layout with key metrics prominently displayed<br />• Add NRR and GRR gauges with benchmark comparisons (target: NRR >100%, GRR >90%)<br />• Include renewal pipeline summary (by stage, by amount, by owner)<br />• Add churn trend chart (rolling 12-month view)<br />• Include segment breakdowns (by tier, industry, contract value)<br />• Add leading indicator widgets (at-risk accounts, overdue renewals)<br />• Set up automated dashboard delivery to leadership |
| 9. Build Operational Renewal Dashboard | 3.5h | Create a working dashboard for CS and Account teams to manage their renewal pipeline day-to-day.
