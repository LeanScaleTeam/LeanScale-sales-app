# Attribution Overview

This page explains attribution models for B2B companies, helping teams understand which marketing touchpoints drive conversions and revenue.

## What is Attribution?

Attribution is the process of identifying and assigning value to different touchpoints or interactions that a customer experiences throughout their journey toward purchasing.

## Three Main Attribution Models

### 1. Direct Source Attribution (First/Last Touch)

- Credits 100% of conversion to a single touchpoint
- **First touch**: credits the initial lead-generating interaction
- **Last touch**: credits the final interaction before conversion

### 2. Influence Attribution

- Provides equal credit to all buyer journey touchpoints
- Can inflate revenue attribution by duplicating credit across interactions

### 3. Distributed Attribution (Multi-Touch)

- Spreads credit across all touchpoints along the buyer journey
- Can use even distribution or weighted allocation based on timing/intent

## Practical Example

Consider a buyer journey with the following touchpoints:

1. Trade show event
2. Email follow-up
3. Website form submission (3 months later)
4. Regional event
5. Purchase

**Attribution outcomes by model:**

| Model | How Credit is Assigned |
|-------|------------------------|
| **Direct** | Sale credited entirely to trade show OR form submission |
| **Influence** | All four touchpoints receive full credit |
| **Distributed** | Each touchpoint receives 25% credit |

## Choosing the Right Model

Select your attribution model based on your objectives:

| Model | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| **Direct Source** | Funnel conversion rates and short-term optimization |
| **Influence** | Campaign comparison (not ideal for ROI measurement) |
| **Distributed** | Measuring marketing ROI (requires longer data maturation) |

## Implementation Recommendation

Begin with direct source attribution using quality first-touch and last-touch data capture processes. This provides a solid foundation before progressing to more complex multi-touch models.
