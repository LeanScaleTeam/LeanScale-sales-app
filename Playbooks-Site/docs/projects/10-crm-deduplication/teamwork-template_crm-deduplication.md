### Task List: (CRM Deduplication) 1. Assessment & Configuration
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Audit Current Duplicate Landscape | 2h | Export sample data and quantify the duplicate problem across CRM objects. End state: Documented baseline of duplicate rates and patterns for contacts, leads, and accounts.<br /><br />• Pull export of contacts, leads, and accounts from CRM (last 90 days of created records minimum)<br />• Run duplicate detection report using native CRM tools or trial of deduplication tool<br />• Categorize duplicates by type: exact email matches, fuzzy name matches, company variations<br />• Calculate duplicate percentage for each object (contacts typically 20-30% in uncleaned databases)<br />• Identify top 5 sources creating duplicates (web forms, imports, manual creation, integrations)<br />• Document sample duplicate clusters showing the merge complexity |
| 2. Interview Stakeholders on Pain Points | 1.5h | Gather qualitative input from CRM users on duplicate-related friction. End state: List of prioritized pain points and business rules that must be preserved during merge.<br /><br />• Interview CRM admin to understand current data entry processes and known problem areas<br />• Interview 2-3 sales reps on "I'm already working that lead" frequency and manual workarounds<br />• Interview marketing ops on email bounce rates and campaign segmentation issues<br />• Document any custom fields or integration IDs that must be preserved during merges<br />• Identify any existing duplicate handling processes (even informal ones) |
| 3. Define Matching Criteria and Master Record Rules | 2h | Establish the technical rules for what constitutes a duplicate and which record wins. End state: Documented deduplication rules approved by stakeholders.<br /><br />• Define primary matching criteria (email address is typically the anchor for B2B)<br />• Define secondary matching criteria (phone, company name + first/last name combination)<br />• Establish fuzzy matching thresholds (how similar must names be to flag as potential duplicates)<br />• Create master record selection hierarchy (e.g., most recent activity > most complete data > oldest created date)<br />• Document special handling for free email domains (Gmail, Hotmail should not be master unless only option)<br />• Get sign-off from RevOps lead and CRM admin on rules before proceeding |
| 4. Evaluate Tool Options Against Requirements | 2.5h | Compare deduplication tool options based on client's CRM, budget, and matching needs. End state: Tool selected with procurement initiated.<br /><br />• Document client's CRM (Salesforce or HubSpot) and any integrations that affect deduplication<br />• Evaluate native CRM tools (Salesforce Duplicate Management, HubSpot native deduplication)<br />• Evaluate third-party options: Insycle, Dedupely, Cloudingo, DemandTools, RingLead<br />• Compare on: fuzzy matching capabilities, preview/undo options, bulk processing limits, cost per user<br />• Consider integration limitations (e.g., HubSpot can't merge companies when Salesforce integration is active)<br />• Present recommendation with pros/cons to client and get budget approval |
| 5. Configure Tool with Matching Rules | 3h | Set up the deduplication tool with the approved matching criteria and merge rules. End state: Tool configured and ready for test run.<br /><br />• Install/connect deduplication tool to CRM environment<br />• Configure primary matching field (email) with exact match rules<br />• Configure secondary matching fields with appropriate fuzzy match thresholds<br />• Set up master record selection logic per approved hierarchy<br />• Configure field merge behavior (which fields take master value vs. concatenate vs. most recent)<br />• Define handling for related records (activities, tasks, opportunities linked to merged records)<br />• Save configuration and document settings for future reference |

### Task List: (CRM Deduplication) 2. Execution, Prevention & Handoff
**Contains:** Parts 3-5

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 6. Run Test Batch and Validate Accuracy | 2h | Process a small test batch to validate matching accuracy before full execution. End state: Validated deduplication rules with acceptable false positive/negative rates.<br /><br />• Select test batch of 300-500 records across objects (contacts, leads, accounts)<br />• Run deduplication tool in preview mode (no actual merges)<br />• Manually review 50+ potential duplicate pairs for accuracy<br />• Calculate false positive rate (records flagged that are NOT duplicates)<br />• Calculate false negative rate (known duplicates that were missed)<br />• Adjust matching thresholds if false positive rate exceeds 5%<br />• Document any edge cases requiring special handling |
| 7. Execute Full Deduplication in Batches | 3.5h | Process all duplicate records in controlled batches with rollback capability. End state: All identified duplicates merged with documented results.<br /><br />• Ensure CRM backup is completed before proceeding (verify with client IT/admin)<br />• Start with lowest-risk object (typically contacts before accounts)<br />• Process in batches of 500-1000 records to maintain control<br />• Review batch results before proceeding to next batch<br />• Document merge counts: records before, records after, merge ratio<br />• Handle exceptions and edge cases flagged during batch processing<br />• Move to next object type after completing current object<br />• Generate final deduplication report with total records merged by object |
| 8. Verify Data Integrity Post-Merge | 1.5h | Confirm that merges preserved critical data and related records remained linked. End state: Verified clean database with no data loss or broken relationships.<br /><br />• Spot-check 20-30 merged records to verify field values preserved correctly<br />• Verify related records (activities, opportunities, tasks) are still linked to surviving records<br />• Check that integration IDs (Salesforce ID, HubSpot ID, etc.) were preserved per rules<br />• Run critical reports/dashboards to confirm data integrity<br />• Address any data issues discovered during verification |
| 9. Set Up Real-Time Duplicate Alerts | 2h | Configure CRM to warn users when creating potential duplicates. End state: Users receive alerts before creating duplicate records.<br /><br />• Enable native duplicate detection rules in CRM (Salesforce Matching Rules, HubSpot duplicate management)<br />• Configure alert behavior (block vs. warn) based on match confidence<br />• Set up duplicate alerts for key entry points: manual creation, lead forms, imports<br />• Configure alert message with guidance on how to find existing record<br />• Test duplicate alert with sample records across each entry point |
| 10. Create Validation Rules to Prevent Duplicates | 2h | Implement hard blocks on duplicate creation where appropriate. End state: System-enforced prevention of obvious duplicates.<br /><br />• Create validation rule to require email address on contact/lead creation (prevents duplicates impossible to match)<br />• Configure required field validation to ensure matching criteria fields are populated<br />• Set up email domain validation (standardize formatting, lowercase)<br />• Create workflow to standardize company names at entry (trim whitespace, standardize abbreviations)<br />• Test validation rules to ensure they don't block legitimate record creation |
| 11. Build Ongoing Automated Scans | 2h | Configure recurring deduplication scans to catch duplicates that slip through prevention. End state: Scheduled automated duplicate detection running weekly/monthly.<br /><br />• Schedule recurring duplicate scan (weekly for high-volume databases, monthly for lower volume)<br />• Configure scan to generate report of potential duplicates for review<br />• Set up notification to RevOps admin when scan completes<br />• Define SLA for reviewing and resolving flagged duplicates<br />• Create process for handling low-confidence matches requiring manual review |
