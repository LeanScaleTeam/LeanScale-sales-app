## Tech Stack

**Stage-appropriate approach:** The tech stack at Platform stage is enterprise-grade, globally available, and governed — consolidation, integration, and data quality take priority over adding new tools.

## Tech Stack Principles

| Principle | Implication |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Consolidation** | Fewer vendors, deeper integrations, lower complexity |
| **Global Availability** | Tools must work across all regions, comply with local regs |
| **Governance** | Change management, approval process, vendor management |
| **Data Quality** | Single source of truth, deduplication, enrichment |
| **Integration** | APIs, data pipelines, real-time sync where needed |

## Platform-Stage Tech Stack

| Category | Platform-Stage Tools | Governance |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **CRM** | Salesforce Enterprise+ | CRM admin team, RevOps governance |
| **Marketing Automation** | Marketo, Eloqua, or HubSpot Enterprise | Marketing Ops |
| **Sales Engagement** | Outreach, SalesLoft, or similar | Sales Ops |
| **CS Platform** | Gainsight, Totango, or ChurnZero | CS Ops |
| **CPQ** | Salesforce CPQ, DealHub, Conga | Deal Desk + RevOps |
| **Conversation Intelligence** | Gong, Chorus, Clari | Enablement |
| **ABM Platform** | 6sense, Demandbase | Marketing Ops |
| **Enrichment** | ZoomInfo, Clearbit | RevOps |
| **BI / Analytics** | Looker, Tableau, Sigma | Data team |
| **Data Warehouse** | Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift | Data team |
| **Integration / iPaaS** | Workato, Tray, MuleSoft | IT + RevOps |

## Vendor Governance

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Vendor Management** | Contract tracking, renewal calendar, business reviews |
| **Security Review** | SOC 2, GDPR compliance for all GTM tools |
| **Budget Ownership** | Clear budget owner per category |
| **Evaluation Process** | RFP process for new tools, cross-functional input |
| **Sunset Process** | Plan for retiring legacy tools |

## Integration Architecture

| Integration Type | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| **CRM ↔ MAP** | Lead/contact sync, campaign attribution |
| **CRM ↔ CS Platform** | Account, opportunity, health sync |
| **CRM ↔ CPQ** | Quote to opportunity, product sync |
| **Product ↔ CS Platform** | Usage data, health scoring inputs |
| **Warehouse ↔ All** | Single source of truth for analytics |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Tool proliferation** — every new tool adds integration burden and data fragmentation
> - **Shadow IT** — unapproved tools create security and data risks
> - **Ignoring legacy debt** — tools added in Scale stage may need replacement or consolidation
