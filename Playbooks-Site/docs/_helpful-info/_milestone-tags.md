## Tag Format Convention

All tags follow these rules:
- **Format:** kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- **Location:** In teamwork template files under `**Tag:** \`tag-name\``
- **Scope:** Same tag used at project level and individual milestone levels

## Usage

When adding tags to a new project:
1. Check this directory for existing tags that match your project's domain
2. Use the exact tag format shown (kebab-case, no spaces)
3. Apply the same tag to both the project header and individual milestones
