# Defining GTM Process

## Market Processes: A Source of Conflict

Market processes can be a significant source of conflict between sales and marketing teams. This stems from the handoff of leads from marketing to sales, where disagreement often arises regarding lead quality, timing of handoffs, and processes for managing and tracking leads.

## Misalignment on Data Definitions and Processes

A common cause of misalignment between sales and marketing teams is lacking agreement on data definitions and processes. This confusion can lead to errors in the lead generation and qualification process. For example, if the sales team uses a different definition of a sales qualified lead (SQL) than the marketing team, the sales team may reject leads that marketing has already qualified as SQLs.

## Routing and Handoffs

To ensure alignment between sales and marketing teams, clearly defined routing and handoff processes are essential. This means specifying:

- What happens when a potential qualified lead (PQL) comes in
- What happens when someone fills out a form on your website
- Who is responsible for managing and handing off those leads

By establishing these processes, you can avoid confusion and ensure that leads receive proper follow-up.

## Aligning All Aspects of the Process

True alignment between sales and marketing teams requires aligning all aspects of the process, including:

- Shared understanding of goals and objectives
- Alignment on metrics
- Agreement on data definitions
- Standardized processes
- Clear routing and handoffs

Taking time to align these elements creates a more efficient and effective lead generation and qualification process.
