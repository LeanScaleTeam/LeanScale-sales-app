Marketing teams identify SQLs as individuals who have interacted with a sales rep and demonstrated alignment with the company's product or service. The assessment considers the prospect's:

- Identified business needs

## Benefits of Clearly Defined ROEs

Organizations benefit from structured SQL definitions through:

- Enhanced communication between sales and marketing departments
- More efficient sales processes
- Increased SQL volume

SQLs form a critical component of effective sales operations. Clear ROEs for SQL qualification strengthen organizational effectiveness and revenue outcomes.
