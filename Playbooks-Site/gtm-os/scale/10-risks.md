## Risks and Challenges

**What kills companies at Scale stage:**

| Risk | Description | Warning Signs |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Heroics over systems** | Relying on individual heroics instead of repeatable process | Top rep carries quota, others struggle |
| **Data mistrust** | "I don't believe those numbers" becomes pervasive | Multiple sources of truth, no reconciliation |
| **Forecasting failures** | Commits that don't close, surprises every quarter | >20% variance, sandbagging/hockey-stick patterns |
| **Tool sprawl** | Too many tools, poor integration, nobody knows what's where | Shadow IT, duplicate data, integration failures |
| **Culture dilution** | Rapid hiring without values alignment | New hires don't "get it," early employees frustrated |
| **Pipeline chaos** | Plenty of activity, no predictability | Coverage looks good, conversion doesn't materialize |
| **Sales-marketing misalignment** | Blame game between functions | "Bad leads" vs. "can't close" |
| **Process debt** | Things that worked at Stabilize break at volume | Bottlenecks, manual processes, tribal knowledge |

## Warning Signs

- Forecast commits miss by >20% regularly
- Top performer carries >40% of team quota
- CRM has multiple conflicting "single sources of truth"
- New reps take >6 months to ramp
- Customer health deteriorates without explanation
- Tools that "everyone uses" have under 50% adoption
- Pipeline coverage is 4x but conversion is declining

## How to Avoid

- **Invest in infrastructure before it's urgent** — RevOps, enablement, process
- **Align on definitions** — what is an MQL? What is Stage 3? What is "commit"?
- **Hire for systems, not heroics** — great process over great individuals
- **Measure and review regularly** — forecast reviews, pipeline reviews, metric reviews
- **Consolidate tools** — fewer, better-integrated tools beat many specialized ones
