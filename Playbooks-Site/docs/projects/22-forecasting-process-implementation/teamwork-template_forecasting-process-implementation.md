### Task List: (Forecasting Process) 1. Assessment, Methodology & Configuration
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Conduct Stakeholder Discovery Interviews | 2h | Interview key stakeholders to document current forecasting practices, pain points, and desired outcomes. End state: Clear understanding of current state gaps and stakeholder expectations documented.<br /><br />• Schedule and conduct 45-60 minute interviews with CRO, VP Sales, and RevOps lead<br />• Document current forecasting methods (spreadsheet-based, CRM-native, third-party tool)<br />• Identify specific pain points (inconsistent submissions, sandbagging, last-minute surprises)<br />• Capture desired outcomes and success criteria from each stakeholder<br />• Map forecast consumers (who uses the forecast and for what decisions)<br />• Document current meeting cadence around forecasting (weekly calls, QBRs, board meetings) |
| 2. Audit Historical Forecast Accuracy | 2.5h | Pull last 4 quarters of forecast vs. actual data to calculate baseline accuracy and identify patterns. End state: Baseline accuracy metrics established with patterns documented.<br /><br />• Extract historical forecast submissions from CRM or spreadsheets (last 4 quarters minimum)<br />• Calculate forecast accuracy by period (Monthly, Quarterly) using formula: 1 - \|Actual - Forecast\| / Actual<br />• Segment accuracy by rep, team, and deal size to identify systematic patterns<br />• Document over-forecasters vs. under-forecasters (sandbagging pattern)<br />• Identify specific deal types or stages where forecasts consistently miss<br />• Create baseline accuracy scorecard to measure improvement against |
| 3. Assess CRM Data Quality and Pipeline Hygiene | 2h | Audit existing CRM fields, opportunity stages, and close date hygiene to identify data quality gaps that will undermine forecast accuracy. End state: Data quality gaps documented with remediation plan.<br /><br />• Pull opportunity report with key fields: Stage, Close Date, Amount, Last Activity Date<br />• Identify stale opportunities (no activity >30 days) as percentage of total pipeline<br />• Audit close date accuracy (how many deals pushed close dates in last 90 days)<br />• Review stage definitions and exit criteria documentation (if exists)<br />• Check for required fields enforcement on opportunities<br />• Document critical data gaps that must be fixed before forecast process can be trusted |
| 4. Select Forecasting Methodology | 2h | Evaluate methodology options against client's data maturity, team size, and tool preferences to recommend approach. End state: Methodology selected with stakeholder alignment.<br /><br />• Present methodology options: weighted pipeline, rep judgment (bottom-up), manager overlay, AI-assisted (Clari/Ebsta)<br />• Assess data maturity requirements for each method (weighted pipeline needs reliable stage probabilities)<br />• Evaluate team size and sales cycle length fit for each approach<br />• Consider hybrid approach (rep judgment + manager overlay is common)<br />• Get stakeholder alignment on selected methodology<br />• Document methodology decision with rationale for future reference |
| 5. Create Forecast Category Definitions | 2h | Define forecast categories with clear, specific criteria that eliminate ambiguity in rep submissions. End state: Documented category definitions with examples that all reps can consistently apply.<br /><br />• Define 3-4 categories: Commit, Best Case, Pipeline, Omitted (avoid over-engineering with more)<br />• Create specific criteria for each category (e.g., "Commit requires: verbal yes, pricing agreed, close date within 30 days, decision-maker confirmed")<br />• Document concrete examples for each category using recent deals as reference<br />• Define what does NOT qualify for each category (exclusion criteria)<br />• Create visual one-pager for rep quick reference<br />• Get VP Sales sign-off on category definitions before CRM configuration |
| 6. Configure CRM Forecast Fields and Hierarchy | 3h | Set up forecast fields, category picklists, and forecast hierarchy in CRM to match org structure. End state: CRM forecast module configured and ready for submissions.<br /><br />• Create or configure Forecast Category picklist field on Opportunity object<br />• Set up forecast hierarchy matching sales org structure (Rep → Manager → Director → VP)<br />• Configure forecast settings (forecast period, submission windows, adjustment permissions)<br />• Set up manager override capability with audit trail<br />• Create forecast submission record type or object (if needed for historical tracking)<br />• Test hierarchy roll-up with sample data to verify accuracy |
| 7. Build Forecast Submission Workflow | 2.5h | Establish submission cadence with automated reminders and deadline enforcement. End state: Automated workflow that prompts timely forecast submissions.<br /><br />• Define submission cadence (weekly roll-up typical, with monthly/quarterly close dates)<br />• Create automated email/Slack reminders for submission deadlines<br />• Configure submission deadline rules (lock forecasts after X date)<br />• Build manager notification for incomplete team submissions<br />• Set up exception handling for new hires or territory changes<br />• Document submission process in one-pager for rep reference |
| 8. Create Forecast Dashboards and Reports | 3.5h | Build forecast vs. actual dashboard with accuracy tracking by rep, team, and period. End state: Executive-ready dashboard showing current forecast, trends, and accuracy metrics.<br /><br />• Build current period forecast summary dashboard (Commit, Best Case, Pipeline totals)<br />• Create forecast vs. actual comparison report with accuracy calculation<br />• Segment accuracy tracking by rep, team, and manager for accountability<br />• Build forecast trend chart showing changes over time within period<br />• Create deal-level drill-down report for forecast review meetings<br />• Set up scheduled dashboard refresh and distribution to leadership |
