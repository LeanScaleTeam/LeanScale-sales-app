# Stage 3: Scale ($5–$15M ARR)

## Overview

## What This Stage Is About

- Adding capacity without adding chaos
- Discovering that "we just need more reps" is never just that — it's process, enablement, territory, comp
- Process debt becoming visible — things that "worked" at Stabilize start breaking at volume
- Data mistrust spreading — "I don't believe those numbers" becomes common
- Forecasting becoming a real discipline (and exposing that nobody knows how to do it)
- Tool sprawl — the stack doubled and nobody knows what integrates with what

The transition from Stabilize to Scale is when the cracks show. The first hire worked, maybe the second. But at 5-10 reps? Everything that was held together with founder attention and tribal knowledge starts failing. Pipeline coverage looks good on paper but deals slip. Forecast commits miss. Marketing qualified leads pile up but don't convert. The CRM is a mess of conflicting definitions.

This stage separates companies that built real systems from those that just got lucky with good people. The ones that survive Scale are the ones that invest in infrastructure while they can still afford to — not after it's an emergency.

## What Breaks at This Stage

- **Onboarding takes too long** — new reps can't ramp because there's no real enablement
- **Tribal knowledge is the only knowledge** — the process is whatever the best rep does
- **Pipeline is unpredictable** — feast or famine, no idea why
- **Forecasting is fiction** — commit vs. close is a gap, not a delta
- **Tool chaos** — three different systems have "the number" and they don't match
- **Marketing-sales misalignment** — "these leads are garbage" vs. "sales can't close"

## Typical Firmographics

- Revenue: $5–$15M ARR
- Headcount: 30–80
- Fundraising: Series A / B
- GTM Complexity: Medium–High — defined funnel, multiple motions, enablement needed
- Product Complexity: Depth increases, integrations emerge

## Main Goal
 Build the infrastructure (people, process, tech) that lets the company triple again without tripling the chaos.
