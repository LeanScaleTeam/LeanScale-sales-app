## Graduation Readiness

These are the signs that it's time to graduate from Optimize stage:

- [ ] Efficiency gains achieved — unit economics are healthy and stable
- [ ] Segments optimized — clear understanding of which segments work and why
- [ ] Processes mature — documented, followed, measured, improved
- [ ] Team depth — not dependent on key individuals
- [ ] Data reliable — decisions made from data, not instinct
- [ ] Revenue approaching $40M ARR
- [ ] Ready for multi-product, multi-geo, or other platform plays
- [ ] Governance questions emerging — "how do we make decisions at scale?"

## What Breaks If Too Early

- Trying to govern before processes are stable
- Multi-geo expansion before efficiency is proven
- M&A before operational excellence
- Complexity before the organization can handle it

## What Breaks If Too Late

- Missing market opportunities while optimizing
- Competitors outpacing in product or market expansion
- Talent stagnation — high performers want growth
- Over-optimization creating rigidity
