## Marketing Processes

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Organizations at Platform stage operate marketing as a multi-product, multi-geo function with specialized teams, robust governance, and sophisticated attribution. Marketing shifts from growth driver to growth infrastructure.

## Content Strategy

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Content at Platform stage is multi-product, localized, and produced at scale with governance — thought leadership, analyst relations, and executive content become strategic priorities.

| Content Type | Platform-Stage Focus |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Thought Leadership** | CEO/C-suite bylines, industry reports, original research |
| **Product Content** | Per product line, per persona, per stage |
| **Localized Content** | Key content translated and culturally adapted |
| **Partner Content** | Co-branded with strategic partners |
| **Analyst Content** | Gartner, Forrester, G2 — briefings and responses |
| **Customer Content** | Case studies at scale, video testimonials, CAB reports |

**Content Governance:**

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Content Strategy** | Annual content plan aligned to GTM priorities |
| **Content Ops** | Centralized production, distributed inputs |
| **Content Quality** | Editorial standards, brand voice, legal review |
| **Content Performance** | Attribution to pipeline, engagement metrics |
| **Content Localization** | Priority languages, adaptation guidelines |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Content without strategy** — volume without intentionality creates noise
> - **Ignoring localization** — if multi-geo, content must adapt
> - **Thought leadership by committee** — executive content needs executive voice

## Website & Positioning

**Stage-appropriate approach:** The website at Platform stage is often multiple sites — product-line sites, regional sites, and partner portals — with centralized governance and sophisticated personalization.

| Property | Purpose | Governance |
|----------|---------|------------|
| **Corporate Site** | Brand, investor relations, company info | Corporate marketing |
| **Product Sites** | Per product line, deep functionality | Product marketing |
| **Regional Sites** | Localized content, regional campaigns | Field marketing |
| **Partner Portal** | Partner resources, deal registration | Partner marketing |
| **Community Site** | User community, forums, knowledge base | Community team |

**Personalization:**

| Dimension | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| **Industry** | Vertical-specific landing pages and case studies |
| **Segment** | Enterprise vs Mid-Market vs SMB messaging |
| **Product Interest** | Behavior-based product recommendations |
| **Account Status** | Customer vs prospect vs partner |
| **Geography** | Language, currency, regional offers |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Single site for everything** — different audiences need different experiences
> - **Inconsistent brand** — freedom without guidelines creates confusion
> - **Static experience** — if everyone sees the same thing, personalization is wasted

## Demand Gen / Paid

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Demand generation at Platform stage runs multi-product, multi-geo campaigns with sophisticated attribution, budget allocation by segment, and close integration with sales development.

| Channel | Platform-Stage Approach |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Paid Search** | Product-line specific, competitive conquesting |
| **Paid Social** | Multi-language, segment-specific, retargeting |
| **Display/Programmatic** | Intent-based, ABM-integrated |
| **Content Syndication** | High-quality leads, content gates, lead scoring |
| **Review Sites** | G2, Capterra — active management, PPC |
| **Sponsorships** | Industry publications, podcasts, newsletters |

**Attribution & Measurement:**

| Model | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| **Multi-touch Attribution** | Pipeline and revenue credit across touchpoints |
| **Marketing Mix Modeling** | Budget allocation, channel efficiency |
| **Incrementality Testing** | Holdout tests for channel validation |
| **ABM Attribution** | Account-level engagement and influence |

**Budget Governance:**

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Annual Planning** | Budget by channel, segment, product |
| **Quarterly Review** | Reallocation based on performance |
| **Monthly Reporting** | Spend vs plan, CPL, pipeline contribution |
| **Regional Allocation** | % of budget for each region |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Single attribution model** — no one model captures reality; use multiple
> - **Set-and-forget budgets** — agility requires reallocation capability
> - **Ignoring brand spend** — not everything is performance; brand matters at scale

## Community & Network

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Community at Platform stage is a strategic asset — user community, developer ecosystem, customer advisory boards, and partner networks create moat and reduce churn.

| Community Type | Purpose | Investment Level |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| **User Community** | Peer support, product feedback, advocacy | Dedicated team |
| **Developer Ecosystem** | Integrations, apps, extensions | Developer relations |
| **Customer Advisory Board** | Strategic input, roadmap validation | Executive program |
| **Partner Network** | Co-sell, co-market, integrations | Partner team |
| **Analyst Relations** | Industry influence, validation | AR specialist |

**Community Metrics:**

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|
| **Active Members** | Engagement health |
| **Peer Support Deflection** | Support cost reduction |
| **NPS of Community Members** | Community satisfaction |
| **Contribution Rate** | % creating vs consuming |
| **Cross-Sell from Community** | Pipeline influence |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Community as afterthought** — community is strategic; treat it that way
> - **Ignoring developer relations** — if APIs matter, developers matter
> - **CAB without action** — if feedback doesn't inform roadmap, trust erodes

> **Playbook Reference:** See Community Growth and Engagement

## Event Strategy

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Events at Platform stage include major owned events, sponsored events globally, and a rigorous ROI framework — events are investment centers, not expense centers.

| Event Type | Scale | Frequency |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Owned Conference** | 1,000-10,000+ attendees | Annual flagship |
| **Regional Events** | 100-500 attendees | Per region, 1-2x/year |
| **Sponsored Conferences** | Booth + speaking | Major industry events |
| **Partner Events** | Co-hosted | With strategic partners |
| **Executive Events** | 20-50 executives | Intimate dinners, roundtables |

| **Budget Allocation** | % of marketing budget, by event type |
| **ROI Framework** | Pipeline attribution, cost per opp |
| **Approval Process** | New event requests, sponsor requests |
| **Post-Event Analysis** | Required debrief, learnings documented |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Events without pipeline goals** — every event should have measurable targets
> - **Sponsorship by habit** — evaluate each sponsorship; don't auto-renew
> - **Owned event without content strategy** — flagship events need flagship content

## ABM (Account-Based Marketing)

**Stage-appropriate approach:** ABM at Platform stage is fully mature — integrated with sales, running at multiple tiers, and tied to pipeline and revenue metrics. ABM is how enterprise deals are won.

| Tier | Approach | Coverage |
|------|----------|----------|
| **1:1 ABM** | Fully customized programs | Top 20-50 accounts |
| **1:Few ABM** | Cluster-based campaigns | Industry/segment clusters |
| **1:Many ABM** | Programmatic personalization | Broader target list |

**ABM Orchestration:**

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Account Selection** | Joint Sales + Marketing, data-driven |
| **Play Library** | Standardized ABM plays by persona/trigger |
| **Orchestration Platform** | 6sense, Demandbase, or equivalent |
| **Sales Alignment** | Weekly SDR/AE sync on ABM accounts |
| **Measurement** | Account engagement score, pipeline influence |

**ABM Metrics:**

| Metric | Target Range |
|--------|-------------|
| **Target Account Engagement** | 60-80% of targets engaged |
| **Pipeline from ABM Accounts** | 40-60% of enterprise pipeline |
| **Velocity Improvement** | 20-30% faster cycle times |
| **Win Rate on ABM Accounts** | 30-50% higher than non-ABM |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **ABM as marketing-only** — without sales alignment, ABM fails
> - **Too many Tier 1 accounts** — if everything is 1:1, nothing is 1:1
> - **ABM without intent data** — flying blind when signals are available

> - **Partner content as afterthought** — partners need assets to sell for you
