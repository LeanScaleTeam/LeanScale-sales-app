# Go-to-Market Lifecycle

The Go-to-Market (GTM) Lifecycle framework serves as the foundation for revenue operations and GTM reporting at startups.

## Overview

This documentation covers:
- Overview of the GTM Lifecycle
- Deep dive into each GTM lifecycle stage
- Golden stages (critical milestones)
- Establishing clear entry criteria
- Measuring the GTM lifecycle
- Building meaningful stages for your business

## Golden Stages

The framework emphasizes critical milestones including:
- Sales-qualified leads (SQL)
- Closed-won opportunities
- Early adoption stages
- First time-to-value events

## Sales Lead GTM Lifecycle Example

The framework provides detailed stage definitions across three categories:

### Lead Stages
Anonymous Visitor → Lead → MQL → SAL → SQL

### Sales Stages
SAL → SQL → SAO → Evaluation/Use Case → Proposal/Negotiation → Closed Won

### Renewal Stages
Renewal → Proposal/Negotiation → Closed Won

## Core Concept

The GTM lifecycle extends beyond traditional sales, encompassing marketing, customer success, and implementation teams. Success requires establishing objective benchmarks for stage transitions and tracking key performance indicators like:
- Sales cycle duration
- Conversion rates
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)
