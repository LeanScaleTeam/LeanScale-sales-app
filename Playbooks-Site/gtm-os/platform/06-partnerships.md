## Partnerships

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Partnerships at Platform stage are a strategic growth lever — channel partners drive meaningful revenue, technology partners create ecosystem moat, and strategic alliances (including M&A) shape market position.

## Partnership Types at Platform Stage

| Partner Type | Value | Investment |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| **Channel/Reseller** | Revenue multiplication, market coverage | Partner program, MDF, enablement |
| **Technology (Integration)** | Product stickiness, ecosystem | Developer resources, co-marketing |
| **SI/Consulting** | Implementation capacity, credibility | Joint solutions, certification |
| **Strategic Alliances** | Market access, joint value creation | Executive relationships, joint GTM |
| **Cloud Marketplaces** | Procurement simplicity, co-sell | Listing, co-sell motion |
| **M&A Targets/Acquirees** | Capability acquisition, market expansion | Integration resources |

## Partner Program Governance

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Tier Structure** | Clear tiers with requirements and benefits |
| **Certification** | Partner sales and technical certification |
| **Deal Registration** | Deal reg process, protection, and conflict resolution |
| **MDF Program** | Market development funds with ROI tracking |
| **Partner Portal** | Self-service enablement, deal management |
| **Partner Success** | Dedicated partner success managers for top tiers |

## Partner Ecosystem Metrics

| Metric | Target Range |
|--------|-------------|
| **Partner-Sourced Revenue** | 20-40% of bookings |
| **Partner-Influenced Revenue** | 40-60% of bookings |
| **Partner Attach Rate** | % of deals with partner involvement |
| **Partner NPS** | Partner satisfaction with program |
| **Time to First Deal** | Partner productivity ramp |

## M&A Considerations

| Stage | GTM Implications |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Target Identification** | Market adjacencies, customer overlap, capability gaps |
| **Due Diligence** | GTM team evaluation, customer retention risk, integration cost |
| **Integration Planning** | Brand strategy, sales territory, customer communication |
| **Day 1 Readiness** | Customer messaging, rep assignment, system integration |
| **Post-Merger Integration** | Quota, comp, territory, tech stack consolidation |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Partners as afterthought** — if partners drive 30%+ of revenue, treat them as strategic
> - **Undefined deal rules** — unclear deal registration leads to channel conflict
> - **Ignoring M&A GTM integration** — acquiring without integration plan destroys value
