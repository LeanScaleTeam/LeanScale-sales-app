Sales stages are defined actions that have been completed rather than showing something that has taken place. This provides a clear understanding of where everything is in the sales process and a better understanding of what's been completed.

The first stage in the sales process is the Sales Qualified Lead stage. This means that the lead has been brought into the sales process.

The next stage is the Demo Completed stage. This means that a demo has been completed.

The third stage is the Use Case Defined stage. This means that the use case for the potential customer has been clearly defined, documented, and shared with the customer.

The fourth stage is the Proposal Sent stage. This means that a formal proposal has been sent to the customer.

The fifth stage is the Negotiations Completed stage. This means that the customer and the salesperson have verbally agreed upon the terms and conditions of the agreement and locked in the pricing of the product or service.

The sixth and final stage is the Closed Won stage. This means that a mutually executed contract has been signed.

The entry criteria for each stage can vary depending on the business. However, some common entry criteria include:

**Sales Qualified Lead: **The lead has been qualified as a potential customer and has a need for the product or service.

**Demo Completed: **A demo of the product or service has been completed.

**Use Case Defined: **The use case for the potential customer has been clearly defined, documented, and shared with the customer.

**Proposal Sent: **A formal proposal has been sent to the customer.

**Negotiations Completed: **The customer and the salesperson have verbally agreed upon the terms and conditions of the agreement and locked in the pricing of the product or service.

**Closed Won: **A mutually executed contract has been signed.

There are two main methodologies for moving from one stage to the next:

**Action-based criteria: **If one action is completed, then the lead is moved to the next stage.

**Qualification methodology: **A qualification methodology is used to assess whether the lead is ready to move to the next stage.

The best methodology for moving from one stage to the next will vary depending on the business.
