## Overview

This interview features Steve Denner, VP of RevOps at owner.com, discussing how to build a high-output revenue operations function with minimal full-time staff by strategically leveraging contractors, agencies, and AI technology.

## Key Themes

### Redefining "Lean"

The conversation clarifies an important distinction: being lean doesn't mean disorganized. Rather, it means "right-sized, agile execution with increasing structure as needed." Steve emphasizes that high-leverage in-house roles should be prioritized while external talent fills delivery gaps.

### Remote Work as Enabler

The shift to remote work fundamentally changed talent acquisition possibilities. Steve's team spans Eastern, Mountain, Pacific, and Asia-Pacific time zones, functioning "like a distributed company." This geographic diversity enables quarterly capability resets and access to specialized talent globally.

### Structured Onboarding for Contractors

A critical infrastructure component is a formal onboarding course for external resources. The curriculum covers:
- Technology stack
- Organizational ownership and decision-making
- Process documentation
- Sprint cadence and definitions of done
- Project roadmaps

"This dramatically reduces productivity ramp time," Steve notes, making contractor integration seamless from day one.

### In-House vs. Outsourced Roles

**Kept In-House:**
- Product owners for four customer-journey verticals
- Compensation and quota-setting lead
- Project manager
- Strategic leadership functions

**Outsourced:**
- Specialized development work
- Technical skill gaps
- Temporary capacity needs

Steve explains: "You can't outsource leadership" or "accountability," positioning these as non-negotiable in-house functions.

### AI as Force Multiplier

AI adoption is in early stages for RevOps but rapidly expanding. Applications include:

- **Data cleaning and list building** using external tools like Clay
- **User story generation** via LLMs ingesting Salesforce metadata
- **QA script automation** to improve regression testing
- **Quota optimization** by analyzing historical performance data
- **Development efficiency** through GitHub repository integration

Steve warns that "as capabilities improve, you'll be expected to be 10 times more efficient," requiring teams to adopt AI-augmented workflows proactively.

### Career Progression Strategy

RevOps leaders advance by:
- Owning the company growth model
- Championing "must-be-true" strategic priorities cross-functionally
- Connecting high-level objectives to daily execution
- Building scalable systems rather than just delivering work

Steve emphasizes that technical excellence alone is insufficient: "Getting to the next level requires being able to build a function, not just execute tasks."

## Practical Implementation

**Hiring and Evaluation:**
- Apply the same interview scorecard used for full-time hires to contractors
- Assess technical ability, ownership, communication, and collaboration
- Daily standups and transparent communication reveal fit early
- Move quickly if partnership doesn't align

**Governance Model:**
- Pod structure: RevOps owner + data/analytics + enablement per functional area
- Cross-functional alignment on priorities
- Clear ownership of customer-journey segments

## Conclusion

The modern RevOps playbook emphasizes intentional staffing, scalable processes, and disciplined AI integration. Success requires strong in-house leadership coupled with a network of specialized external resources, all unified through rigorous documentation and agile methodology.
