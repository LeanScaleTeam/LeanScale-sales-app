## Strategic Insights

The discussion emphasizes lifting B and C performers incrementally rather than focusing solely on top performers. With "85% of B-C sellers" as a target market, even modest improvements compound significantly across larger sales organizations.

Data foundation is positioned as critical for AI implementation success, with emphasis on ontology, clean data structures, and proper data organization before layering AI tools.

## Main Takeaway

Ebsta provides unified revenue intelligence within Salesforce, enabling data-driven decisions for reps, managers, and executives through comprehensive visibility into pipeline health, relationship strength, and forecasting accuracy.
