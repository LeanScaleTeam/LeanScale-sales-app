## Sales Processes

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Sales processes at Optimize are about segment specialization and efficiency optimization. The processes exist from Scale — now they get tuned for different customer segments, pricing complexity increases, and unit economics become the scorecard.

## ICP / Personas

**Stage-appropriate approach:** ICP is now segment-specific with documented personas per segment. Not just "who do we sell to?" but "who do we sell to in each segment, with what motion, at what ACV, with what success criteria?"

**ICP at Optimize:**

| Element | How It Evolves |
|---------|----------------|
| **Segmentation** | Clear segment definitions with distinct characteristics |
| **Persona depth** | Detailed personas per segment, not just per company |
| **Buying committee** | Mapped by segment — enterprise has more stakeholders |
| **Success criteria** | Segment-specific metrics and outcomes |
| **Disqualification** | Clear "not for us" criteria per segment |

**Segment-specific ICP example:**

| Dimension | Enterprise | Mid-Market | SMB |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-----|
| **Company size** | 1,000+ employees | 100-1,000 employees | Under 100 employees |
| **Typical ACV** | $100K+ | $25K-$75K | $5K-$15K |
| **Buying committee** | 5-10 stakeholders | 2-4 stakeholders | 1-2 decision makers |
| **Sales cycle** | 6-12 months | 2-4 months | 2-6 weeks |
| **Primary persona** | VP/C-level + Champion | Director + Practitioner | Owner or Manager |
| **Success motion** | High-touch, strategic | Scaled playbooks | Digital + self-serve |

**What NOT to do:**
- **One-size-fits-all ICP** — segments need distinct targeting
- **Persona proliferation** — 2-3 key personas per segment, not 10
- **Ignoring segment economics** — each segment needs to work financially

## Qualification

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Qualification methodology is segment-specific. Enterprise deals warrant full MEDDIC; SMB might use a streamlined 3-question qualification. The goal is qualification efficiency — not over-qualifying small deals or under-qualifying large ones.

**Qualification by segment:**

| Segment | Methodology | Depth | Key Questions |
|---------|-------------|-------|---------------|
| **Enterprise** | Full MEDDIC/MEDDPICC | Deep discovery, 2-3 calls | Decision process, Paper process, Champion access |
| **Mid-Market** | MEDDIC light or BANT+ | 1-2 discovery calls | Budget, Authority, Timeline + pain depth |
| **SMB** | Streamlined (3-5 questions) | Often single call | Need, Fit, Urgency, Budget |

**Qualification efficiency metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Time in qualification** | Segment-appropriate | Enterprise can take longer; SMB should be fast |
| **Qualification-to-opportunity %** | 60-80% | Below = over-qualifying; Above = under-qualifying |
| **Stage 1 → Stage 2 conversion** | 70-85% | Drop-off here signals qualification gaps |
| **Rep time per qualification** | Decreasing | Efficiency should improve over time |

**What NOT to do:**
- **Same process for all segments** — wastes time on small deals, misses risk on large ones
- **Skipping qualification for "obvious" deals** — often the ones that slip
- **Over-automating enterprise qualification** — complex deals need human judgment

## Sales Stage Entry/Exit

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Segment-specific stage criteria with clear exit gates. Enterprise might have 7+ stages with formal milestones; SMB might have 4 stages with velocity focus. The key is appropriate rigor per segment.

**Segment-specific stage design:**

| Stage | Enterprise | Mid-Market | SMB |
|-------|-----------|------------|-----|
| **1 - Discovery** | Multi-meeting discovery, stakeholder mapping | 1-2 discovery calls | Single discovery call |
| **2 - Qualification** | Full MEDDIC completed, Champion identified | BANT+ confirmed | Need + budget confirmed |
| **3 - Solution** | Custom solution design, technical validation | Demo + use case mapping | Standard demo |
| **4 - Proposal** | Proposal review, negotiation | Proposal + questions | Quote sent |
| **5 - Negotiation** | Commercial negotiation, legal/procurement | Pricing discussion | N/A (often combined) |
| **6 - Closing** | Contract execution, signature | Close | Close |
| **7 - Implementation** | Handoff to CS, kickoff | Handoff | Handoff |

**Stage hygiene at Optimize:**

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| **Weekly stage audits** | Catch deals in wrong stages before forecast |
| **Stage aging alerts** | Deals stuck in stage signal problems |
| **Manager deal reviews** | Validate stage accuracy for large deals |
| **Quarterly stage calibration** | Ensure criteria still match reality |

**What NOT to do:**
- **Uniform stages across segments** — creates friction and poor forecasting
- **Too many stages** — complexity without insight
- **Stage advancement without criteria** — "feels like Stage 3" isn't a methodology

## Deck and Demo Process

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Persona-specific decks and demos, not just segment-specific. Enterprise Champions need different content than Economic Buyers. Demo environments are segment-appropriate — full environments for enterprise, streamlined for SMB.

**Deck strategy at Optimize:**

| Asset | Purpose | Variations |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Intro deck** | First meeting, positioning | By segment + persona |
| **Value deck** | Business case, ROI | By segment + use case |
| **Technical deck** | Architecture, security | Enterprise-focused |
| **Executive summary** | CxO-level overview | Enterprise + MM |
| **Case study collection** | Proof points | By segment + industry |

**Demo environment strategy:**

| Segment | Demo Approach | Environment |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Enterprise** | Custom demo with their data/scenarios | Dedicated demo instance, possibly POC |
| **Mid-Market** | Semi-custom with industry relevance | Shared demo instance with customization |
| **SMB** | Standard demo, efficient | Standard demo environment |

**Demo efficiency metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Signal |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Demo prep time** | Decreasing | Efficiency improving |
| **Demo-to-proposal %** | 60-80% | Demo effectiveness |
| **Demo no-shows** | Under 10% | Qualification + scheduling quality |
| **Average demo length** | Appropriate to segment | Efficiency vs thoroughness |

**What NOT to do:**
- **One demo for everyone** — misses segment-specific needs
- **Too much customization** — kills efficiency for smaller deals
- **Demo without qualification** — wastes time, lowers conversion

## Proposal and Quote Generation

**Stage-appropriate approach:** CPQ (Configure-Price-Quote) becomes relevant at Optimize for organizations with pricing complexity. Structured pricing with clear approval workflows. Deal Desk involvement for non-standard terms.

**CPQ consideration at Optimize:**

| Factor | CPQ Likely Needed | CPQ Can Wait |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| **Product complexity** | Multiple SKUs, bundles, add-ons | Single product, simple tiers |
| **Pricing complexity** | Volume-based, usage-based, custom | Standard tiers |
| **Deal volume** | 50+ quotes/month | Lower volume |
| **Approval complexity** | Multi-level approvals needed | Simple approval chain |
| **Error rate** | Quote errors causing issues | Low error rate |

**Pricing governance at Optimize:**

| Deal Size | Approval Authority | Process |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| **Standard (within list)** | AE self-serve | Automated quote |
| **Discount 0-15%** | Sales Manager | Manager approval |
| **Discount 15-25%** | Director + Deal Desk | Deal review required |
| **Discount >25%** | VP Sales + Finance | Executive deal desk |
| **Non-standard terms** | Legal + Deal Desk | Terms review |

**Proposal components at Optimize:**

- **Executive summary** — segment-appropriate length and depth
- **Solution scope** — detailed for enterprise, streamlined for SMB
- **Investment section** — pricing, payment terms, timeline
- **Success criteria** — agreed-upon metrics
- **Terms and conditions** — segment-appropriate complexity
- **Next steps** — clear path to close

**What NOT to do:**
- **No pricing governance** — discounts without strategy erode margin
- **Over-engineering for simplicity** — CPQ for simple products adds friction
- **Missing Deal Desk when needed** — non-standard deals need oversight

## CS Handoff

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Platform-supported handoff with automated triggers. The handoff process is now embedded in systems — CRM triggers CS platform, information flows automatically, nothing gets lost.

**Handoff automation at Optimize:**

| Trigger | Automated Action | Human Action |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Deal marked Closed Won** | CS notified, account created in CS platform | CS reviews, schedules kickoff |
| **Contract signed** | Onboarding workflow initiated | AE sends warm intro |
| **Implementation data** | Pulled from opportunity fields | CS validates completeness |
| **Success criteria** | Populated from sales process | CS confirms with customer |

**Handoff quality metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Signal |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Time to first CS contact** | Under 24 hours | Speed of engagement |
| **Handoff completeness** | >90% fields populated | Process compliance |
| **Customer reported issues** | Under 5% | Handoff quality |
| **AE-CS alignment scores** | >4/5 satisfaction | Relationship health |

**Segment-specific handoff:**

| Segment | Handoff Model |
|---------|--------------|
| **Enterprise** | Named CSM assignment, formal kickoff meeting, AE stays engaged |
| **Mid-Market** | Pooled CSM, automated kickoff, AE available for questions |
| **SMB** | Digital onboarding, CSM for escalation, AE done at signature |

**What NOT to do:**
- **Manual handoffs at scale** — creates gaps and errors
- **AE disappears immediately** — hurts customer experience
- **No success criteria documentation** — CS starts blind

## Territory Design

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Territory optimization based on data. Not just "balanced territories" but territories designed for segment-specific efficiency, rep specialization, and unit economics.

**Territory optimization at Optimize:**

| Dimension | Optimization Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Coverage model** | Segment-specific: Named accounts (Enterprise), Geographic (MM), Industry vertical |
| **Balance factors** | ARR potential, account count, growth opportunity, renewal base |
| **Rep specialization** | Segment specialists, possibly industry specialists |
| **Expansion territories** | Separate from new business, or combined with ownership rules |
| **Partner overlay** | Territory considerations for partner-sourced deals |

**Territory analytics:**

| Metric | What It Tells |
|--------|---------------|
| **Territory productivity variance** | >2x variance signals rebalancing needed |
| **Territory quota coverage** | Should be relatively even after accounting for rep tenure |
| **Account penetration by territory** | Identifies over/under-worked territories |
| **Win rate by territory** | Surfaces territory-specific issues |

**Territory review cadence:**

| Review Type | Frequency | Focus |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **Performance review** | Monthly | Metric tracking |
| **Adjustment review** | Quarterly | Minor rebalancing |
| **Redesign review** | Annual | Major restructuring |

**What NOT to do:**
- **Equal territories** — fair isn't optimal; balance for performance
- **Constant re-cutting** — territorial stability has value
- **Ignoring expansion** — expansion territories need design attention

**Playbook reference:** → Sales Territory Design (optimization focus)

## Commission Plan Design

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Segment-specific comp plans with role-based structures. Enterprise AEs have different plans than SMB reps. Accelerators and decelerators are meaningful. Comp plans align with unit economics goals.

**Comp plan by segment:**

| Element | Enterprise | Mid-Market | SMB |
|---------|-----------|------------|-----|
| **OTE ratio** | 50/50 or 55/45 | 55/45 or 60/40 | 60/40 or 65/35 |
| **Primary metric** | ARR or TCV | ARR | Monthly bookings |
| **Quota** | Lower deal count, higher value | Medium | Higher volume |
| **Accelerators** | Kick in at 80-100% | Kick in at 100%+ | Kick in at 100%+ |
| **Decelerators** | Rare | Consider below threshold | Common below 80% |

**Comp plan sophistication at Optimize:**

| Component | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Accelerators** | Reward over-performance, retain top reps |
| **Decelerators** | Protect margin, signal underperformance |
| **SPIFFs** | Short-term focus on strategic priorities |
| **Multi-year weighting** | If multi-year contracts, appropriate credit |
| **Expansion credit** | Align AE/CSM incentives on expansion |
| **Clawbacks** | Churn accountability (carefully designed) |

**Comp plan design principles:**

- **Simplicity over perfection** — reps should understand their comp
- **Alignment with company goals** — comp drives behavior
- **Segment-appropriate** — different economics, different plans
- **Data-backed quotas** — quotas from models, not negotiation
- **Regular review** — annual redesign, quarterly check-ins

**What NOT to do:**

- **Over-complicating** — more than 3-4 comp components creates confusion
- **Misaligned incentives** — paying for behaviors that hurt unit economics
- **Ignoring churn** — no accountability for early churn
- **Changing mid-year** — destroys trust; changes should be planned
