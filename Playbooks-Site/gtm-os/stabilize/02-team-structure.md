## GTM Team Structure

**The model at Stabilize stage: Founder + First Hires + AI Agents**

The team is no longer solo. With 1-3 GTM hires, organizations learn that hiring doesn't solve problems — it reveals them. The founder is shifting from "doing" to "enabling," but can't fully let go yet.

| Function             | Human                                    | AI Agents        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Sales**            | Founder + first AE or SDR                | Automated: lead enrichment, CRM hygiene, sequence sends. Work: deal coaching, call review, competitive intel |
| **Marketing**        | Founder + first marketing hire or agency | Automated: content distribution, social scheduling, lead routing. Work: content drafting, campaign analysis |
| **Customer Success** | First CS hire (or founder still involved) | Automated: onboarding sequences, renewal reminders, usage alerts. Work: QBR prep, health analysis |
| **Partnerships**     | Founder-led if relevant (usually still too early) | — |
| **RevOps**           | Contractor or fractional (rarely full-time yet) | Automated: data deduplication, enrichment. Work: reporting, process documentation |

## The First Hire Decision

| Role | Hire First If... | Common Mistake |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| **SDR** | Founder is drowning in top-of-funnel, has proven messaging | Hiring before knowing what "good" looks like |
| **AE** | Founder is closing but can't handle volume, has documented motion | Hiring before the motion is repeatable |
| **Demand Gen** | Inbound works, need more volume | Hiring before knowing what converts |
| **CS** | Customers churning, founder can't stay close to all of them | Hiring before understanding why customers succeed |
| **RevOps** | CRM is a mess, nobody trusts the data | Hiring before there's a motion to operationalize |

## When to Hire a Human

- The team needs someone who can take ownership of a function and make judgment calls (not just execute)
- Training/coaching is required for other humans (AI can prep, humans must coach)
- Relationship continuity matters for deals or accounts (key accounts, enterprise)
- The volume is too high for AI-augmented founder to handle (20+ demos/month)
- The motion needs to work without the founder (fundraising, scaling)

## Key Mistakes

- **Hiring too senior** — VP of Sales with no team to lead, wants to "build process" before proving the motion works
- **Hiring too junior** — Entry-level SDR who needs heavy management when founder has no time to manage
- **Hiring before documenting** — "I'll figure it out when they start" leads to failed ramps
- **Not using AI to extend new hires** — First AE should have AI agents helping them, not doing everything manually
