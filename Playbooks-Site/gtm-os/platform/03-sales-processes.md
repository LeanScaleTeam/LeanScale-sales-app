## Sales Processes

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Organizations at Platform stage operate with fully specialized sales teams across multiple segments, products, and geographies. The focus shifts from building sales capacity to ensuring consistency, governance, and continuous optimization at scale.

## ICP / Personas

**Stage-appropriate approach:** ICPs and personas are now multi-dimensional — defined not just by company characteristics but by product fit, regional considerations, and buying committee composition across multiple stakeholders.

| Dimension | Platform-Stage Reality |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Products** | Each product line has distinct ICP and personas |
| **Segments** | Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB each have refined profiles |
| **Geographies** | Regional variations (EMEA, APAC, LATAM) in buying behavior |
| **Buying Committees** | 5-10+ stakeholders mapped with influence and priority |
| **Use Cases** | Multiple entry points and expansion paths per account |

**ICP Governance:**
- Central ICP definition with regional adaptation guidelines
- Quarterly ICP review cadence with Product, Marketing, and Sales
- Trigger definitions for cross-product and expansion opportunities
- Exclusion criteria as important as inclusion criteria

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Abandoning ICP discipline for logo acquisition** — chasing brand names that don't fit creates expensive failures
> - **Allowing regional ICPs to diverge completely** — some localization is necessary, fragmentation is not
> - **Ignoring product-fit signals** — forcing multi-product deals when single-product is the right motion

## Qualification

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Qualification at Platform stage is rigorous, multi-product aware, and integrated into every stage of the sales process. Deal complexity requires clear qualification frameworks that prevent wasted cycles.

| Framework | Application at Platform Stage |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| **MEDDPICC** | Standard for Enterprise; mandate + economic buyer + decision process + paper process + identified pain + champion + competition |
| **BANT-lite** | Mid-Market velocity motion; budget + authority + need + timing for faster qualification |
| **Product-Fit Assessment** | Which products are relevant, what's the entry point, what's the expansion path |
| **Multi-thread Score** | Number of relationships across buying committee; minimum thresholds by deal size |

**Qualification Gates:**

| Stage | Required Qualification |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Discovery → Demo** | Pain validated, stakeholder access, budget range confirmed |
| **Demo → Evaluation** | Technical validation plan, decision process mapped, timeline committed |
| **Evaluation → Negotiation** | Champion confirmed, paper process understood, competition known |
| **Negotiation → Close** | All MEDDPICC elements validated, legal/procurement engaged |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Skipping qualification for "strategic" deals** — every deal gets qualified; strategic doesn't mean unqualified
> - **Single-threading large deals** — if only one person is bought in, the deal is at risk
> - **Qualification as one-time event** — qualification is continuous, not a box to check

> **Playbook Reference:** See Qualification Framework, MEDDPICC, Discovery Call Process

## Sales Stage Entry/Exit

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Stage definitions at Platform stage are precise, multi-track (different processes for different products/segments), and tied to specific verification criteria — not just rep judgment.

| Track | Stages | Key Differences |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **Enterprise** | 7-8 stages, 90-180 day cycles | Executive engagement gates, multi-threaded validation |
| **Commercial** | 5-6 stages, 30-60 day cycles | Faster progression, demo-to-close compression |
| **PLG-to-Sales** | 4-5 stages, PQL-triggered | Usage triggers, expansion-first framing |
| **Partner-Sourced** | 6-7 stages, partner involvement gates | Channel manager checkpoints, co-sell milestones |

**Verification Criteria (Enterprise Example):**

| Stage | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria | Verification Method |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **0 - Prospect** | Fit ICP, initial engagement | Discovery scheduled | SDR handoff notes |
| **1 - Discovery** | First call completed | Pain validated, stakeholders identified | Call recording review |
| **2 - Demo** | Demo delivered | Technical fit confirmed, evaluation plan | SE validation |
| **3 - Evaluation** | POC/trial in progress | Success criteria met | Technical report |
| **4 - Proposal** | Proposal delivered | Business case accepted | Buying committee feedback |
| **5 - Negotiation** | Commercial terms in discussion | Legal/procurement engaged | Contract redlines |
| **6 - Commit** | Verbal commit | Signature timeline | Executive confirmation |
| **7 - Closed Won** | Contract signed | Payment terms confirmed | Legal confirmation |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **One stage process for all segments** — Enterprise and SMB are different motions; treat them that way
> - **Manual stage updates without verification** — if reps can advance stages without proof, your pipeline is fiction
> - **Ignoring multi-product complexity** — bundle deals and expansions need their own stage considerations

## Deck and Demo Process

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Decks and demos are modular, persona-specific, and governed by product marketing with sales enablement. One-size-fits-all is long gone.

| Asset Type | Governance | Variations |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| **Corporate Deck** | Marketing-owned, exec-approved | Quarterly update, used for early stage |
| **Product Decks** | PMM-owned, by product line | Feature updates with releases |
| **Persona Decks** | PMM-owned, by buyer type | CIO vs VP Eng vs practitioner |
| **Vertical Decks** | Industry marketing-owned | Healthcare, Financial Services, etc. |
| **Demo Environments** | SE-owned, multiple instances | Standard demo, industry demo, integration demo |

**Demo Governance:**

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Certification** | SEs certified on each product before demo-ready status |
| **Standard Flows** | Documented demo flows for common personas/use cases |
| **Custom Demos** | Request process for bespoke demos; SE manager approval |
| **Demo Data** | Standardized data sets; industry-specific data available |
| **Integration Demos** | Pre-built integrations with common tech stack partners |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Outdated decks in the field** — if reps are using last quarter's deck, enablement is broken
> - **Demo without discovery** — understanding the customer before showing anything is non-negotiable
> - **Rogue demo environments** — every demo should be in a controlled, current environment

> **Playbook Reference:** See Sales Deck Development, Customer Discovery Interview Process, Demo and Proof of Concept

## Proposal and Quote Generation

**Stage-appropriate approach:** CPQ (Configure-Price-Quote) is required at Platform stage. The complexity of products, pricing tiers, discounting rules, and multi-year/multi-geo deals cannot be managed manually.

| Component | Platform-Stage Requirement |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **CPQ Tool** | Salesforce CPQ, DealHub, Conga, or similar fully implemented |
| **Product Catalog** | All products, SKUs, bundles, add-ons maintained in CPQ |
| **Pricing Rules** | List price, discount tiers, floor prices, approval triggers |
| **Approval Workflow** | Auto-approvals within thresholds, escalation for exceptions |
| **Contract Generation** | Automated from CPQ to contract template |
| **Multi-Currency** | Pricing in local currencies, conversion rules |

**Approval Matrix Example:**

| Discount Level | Approver | Turnaround |
|---------------|----------|------------|
| 0-10% | Rep (auto-approved) | Immediate |
| 10-20% | Sales Manager | Same day |
| 20-30% | Sales Director + Deal Desk | 24 hours |
| 30-40% | VP Sales | 48 hours |
| 40%+ | CRO + CFO | Case-by-case |

**Deal Desk Functions:**

- Pricing guidance and discount recommendations
- Non-standard term evaluation
- Multi-year and multi-product deal structuring
- Legal and finance coordination
- Competitive response pricing

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Manual quoting** — spreadsheet-based quotes are error-prone and unscalable
> - **Inconsistent discounting** — without CPQ guardrails, margin erosion is inevitable
> - **Slow approval cycles** — if deals die waiting for approval, the process is broken

> **Playbook Reference:** See CPQ Implementation, Proposal and Quote Generation

## CS Handoff

**Stage-appropriate approach:** CS handoff at Platform stage is automated, multi-system, and triggered by specific deal and customer attributes — not a single email or call.

| Trigger | Action | Timing |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Close-Won** | Auto-create customer record in CS platform | Immediate |
| **Close-Won** | Assign CSM based on segment + region + product | Same day |
| **Close-Won** | Internal handoff meeting scheduled | Within 2 days |
| **Contract Signed** | Implementation kickoff triggered | Within 1 week |
| **Implementation Complete** | Transition to ongoing success plan | Per timeline |

**Handoff Data Flow:**

| System | Data | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| **CRM → CS Platform** | Deal details, contacts, notes, products purchased | Customer context |
| **CRM → Implementation** | SOW terms, success criteria, timeline | Delivery scope |
| **Call Recordings** | Discovery and demo calls | Voice of customer |
| **Legal System** | Contract terms, SLAs, special commitments | Compliance tracking |
| **CPQ** | Pricing, discounts, expansion potential | Expansion planning |

**Handoff Meeting Structure:**

| Section | Duration | Owner |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Deal Overview | 10 min | AE |
| Customer Goals | 10 min | AE |
| Technical Context | 10 min | SE |
| Implementation Plan | 10 min | PS/CSM |
| Risk Flags | 10 min | All |
| Open Questions | 10 min | CSM |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Manual handoff via email** — if handoff isn't systematized, customers fall through cracks
> - **Handoff without implementation readiness** — CSM meeting the customer before implementation is ready wastes everyone's time
> - **Losing call recordings** — the voice of customer from sales is invaluable for CS

## Territory Design

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Territory design at Platform stage is multi-dimensional — geography, segment, product, and named accounts all factor in. Territories are reviewed quarterly with capacity modeling.

| Dimension | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| **Geography** | Primary axis for field sales; regions → territories → zip codes |
| **Segment** | Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB with distinct coverage models |
| **Vertical** | Industry overlays for specialized verticals (FSI, Healthcare, etc.) |
| **Named Accounts** | Top accounts assigned regardless of geography |
| **Partner-Covered** | Territories where partners are primary, reps are secondary |

**Coverage Model by Segment:**

| Segment | Model | Rep Capacity |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Enterprise** | Named accounts | 10-15 accounts per rep |
| **Mid-Market** | Territory-based | 100-150 accounts per rep |
| **SMB** | Pooled/round-robin | 300+ accounts per rep |
| **Global Accounts** | Dedicated SAM | 2-5 accounts per SAM |

**Capacity Planning:**

| Factor | Measurement |
|--------|-------------|
| **TAM by Territory** | Total addressable market in each territory |
| **Quota Coverage** | Sum of quotas vs. target bookings |
| **Quota Attainment History** | Historical performance by territory |
| **Account Penetration** | % of addressable accounts with activity |
| **Expansion Potential** | Whitespace in existing customers |

**Territory Review Cadence:**

- **Annual:** Major restructuring, new geo expansion, new product territories
- **Quarterly:** Capacity adjustments, rep changes, named account reassignments
- **Monthly:** Exception handling, disputed accounts, special assignments

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Constant territory changes** — reps need stability to build relationships; annual changes max
> - **Ignoring partner territories** — if partners are growing a region, let them; don't compete
> - **Pure account count allocation** — account potential matters more than account count

> **Playbook Reference:** See Territory Design and Quota Allocations

## Commission Plan Design

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Commission plans at Platform stage are complex, multi-component, and require governance to prevent gaming and ensure alignment with company objectives.

| Role | Commission Structure | Complexity |
|------|---------------------|------------|
| **Enterprise AE** | Base + commission + accelerators + SPIFs | 50/50 to 60/40 base/variable |
| **Commercial AE** | Base + commission + accelerators | 60/40 to 50/50 |
| **SDR** | Base + bonus on SALs/SQLs + accelerators | 70/30 to 80/20 |
| **SE** | Base + team bonus + deal bonus | 80/20 to 90/10 |
| **CSM** | Base + retention bonus + expansion commission | 80/20 to 70/30 |
| **Channel Manager** | Base + partner-sourced revenue | 60/40 |

**Commission Components:**

| Component | Purpose | Typical Weight |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **Base Commission** | Core compensation for quota attainment | 60-70% of variable |
| **Accelerators** | Reward over-performance | Kicks in at 100%+ |
| **Multi-Year Bonus** | Incentivize long-term deals | Per-year bonus |
| **Strategic Product Bonus** | Push new product adoption | SPIF or multiplier |
| **Retention/Expansion** | For renewal-focused roles | % of retained/expanded ARR |

**Governance:**

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Plan Documentation** | Comp plans fully documented, legally reviewed |
| **Dispute Resolution** | Clear process for commission disputes |
| **Shadow Accounting** | Reps can see their commissions in real-time |
| **Clawback Policy** | Standard clawback for churn within X months |
| **Change Management** | Any mid-year plan changes require CEO approval |

> **What NOT to do at this stage:**
>
> - **Changing plans mid-year** — unless absolutely necessary, plan changes destroy trust
> - **Unmeasurable components** — if reps can't calculate their commission, the plan is broken
> - **Misaligned incentives** — if discounting is rewarded, reps will discount; incent what you want
