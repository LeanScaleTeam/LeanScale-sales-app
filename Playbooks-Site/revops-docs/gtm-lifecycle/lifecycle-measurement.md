# Lifecycle Measurement

The GTM lifecycle process serves as the foundation for revenue operations, spanning from lead generation through customer retention while providing critical insights into GTM effectiveness.

## Five Core Measurement Categories

### 1. Production by Stage

Tracking output volume at each phase reveals operational efficiency.

**Key indicators:**
- Marketing qualified leads (MQLs) generated
- Sales qualified leads (SQLs) created
- Closed opportunities
- Customers entering early adoption phases

**Why it matters:** Production metrics show whether your funnel has adequate volume at each stage.

### 2. Stage Conversion

Understanding progression rates between phases identifies bottlenecks.

**Key conversions to measure:**
- MQL → SQL
- SQL → Closed Opportunity
- Closed Opportunity → Customer
- Onboarding → Early Adoption

**Why it matters:** Low conversion rates indicate process issues or qualification problems.

### 3. Time in Stage

Duration metrics expose process efficiency.

**Key time metrics:**
- Proposal-to-negotiation completion time
- Onboarding-to-implementation duration
- Average sales cycle length
- Time to first value

**Why it matters:** Extended time in any stage signals friction that needs attention.

### 4. Reasons for Drop-Off

Analyzing attrition points enables targeted improvements.

**Questions to answer:**
- Why do prospects stall at MQL?
- What causes onboarding delays?
- Why do deals die in negotiation?

**Why it matters:** Understanding drop-off reasons allows you to fix the root cause, not just the symptoms.

### 5. Cost to Enter Stage

Evaluating acquisition expenses at each touchpoint assesses GTM efficiency.

**Metrics to track:**
- Cost per MQL
- Cost per SQL
- Cost per Opportunity
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Why it matters:** Efficiency metrics ensure sustainable growth and inform budget allocation.

## Segmentation

Add granular insights by segmenting these metrics:

- **By individual contributor** - Identify top performers and coaching opportunities
- **By customer segment** - Understand which segments convert best
- **By geographic region** - Spot regional performance differences
- **By lead source** - Determine highest-quality channels
- **By deal size** - Compare velocity across deal tiers

## The Core Value Proposition

> "Regularly monitoring these metrics and taking data-driven actions will enable you to continuously improve your GTM strategy and maintain competitive advantage."
