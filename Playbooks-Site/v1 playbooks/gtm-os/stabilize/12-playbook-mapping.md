## Playbook Mapping: Stabilize Stage

### Essential (Do These)

| Playbook | Why Now |
|----------|---------|
| **Sales Lifecycle** | Reps need defined stages and exit criteria |
| **Customer Lifecycle** | CS needs onboarding and renewal process |
| **Lead Lifecycle** | Basic lead management for marketing |
| **Sales Qualification Methodology** | Reps need qualification criteria |
| **Sales to CS Handoff Process** | Handoff breaks without process |
| **Onboarding and Process Improvement** | First CS hire needs a playbook |

### Recommended (If Time/Budget)

| Playbook | Why Consider |
|----------|--------------|
| **Lead Routing** | If you have multiple reps |
| **Automated Inbound Data Enrichment** | Scale top of funnel |
| **Marketing Automation Platform** | Real nurture flows |
| **CRM Deduplication** | Data is getting messy |
| **NPS and Voice of Customer** | Systematize feedback |

### Premature (Avoid For Now)

| Playbook | Why Wait |
|----------|----------|
| **Sales Territory Design** | Wait until 3+ reps |
| **Forecasting Process** | Not enough data yet |
| **ABM/ABS Process** | ICP not proven enough |
| **Customer Success Platform** | Too few customers |
| **CPQ Implementation** | Pricing not stable |
| **Quotas and Target Setting** | Wait for rep data |

## What to Skip at Stabilize Stage

These aren't worth the investment yet — teams at this stage don't have the volume, data, or capacity to make them work:

**Sales:**
- **Complex territory models** — Simple rules are enough for 2-3 reps
- **Sophisticated forecasting** — Not enough history to forecast accurately
- **CPQ/Configure-Price-Quote** — Pricing still needs flexibility
- **Advanced sales enablement** — First, prove reps can sell

**Marketing:**
- **ABM/Account-Based Marketing** — Prove the motion works broadly first
- **Marketing ops hire** — Generalist can handle basics
- **Expensive content production** — Founder voice still matters more

**Customer Success:**
- **CS Platform (Gainsight/ChurnZero)** — Too few customers
- **Predictive health scoring** — Not enough data
- **Formal expansion playbooks** — Find the pattern first

**Operations:**
- **RevOps hire (full-time)** — Contractor/fractional is enough
- **Enterprise BI** — CRM dashboards work fine
- **Complex integrations** — Keep the stack simple
