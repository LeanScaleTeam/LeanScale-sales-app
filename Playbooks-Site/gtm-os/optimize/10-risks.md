## Risks and Challenges

**What undermines organizations at Optimize stage:**

| Risk | Description | Warning Signs | How to Avoid |
|------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Margin erosion** | Costs growing faster than revenue; efficiency gains not materializing | CAC rising, payback extending, magic number declining | Monitor unit economics religiously; address inefficiency early |
| **Process bloat** | Bureaucracy slowing everything; too many approvals, handoffs | Deal velocity slowing, team frustration, "we can't move fast" | Regular process audits; kill unnecessary steps |
| **Misaligned incentives** | Comp plans driving wrong behavior; optimizing wrong metrics | Behaviors don't match goals, gaming the system | Align comp with company goals; simplify plans |
| **Reporting overload** | More dashboards than insights; more meetings than decisions | "We need more data" but no action; analysis paralysis | Focus on actionable metrics; fewer, better reports |
| **Innovation stagnation** | So focused on optimizing that growth opportunities get missed | Falling behind competitors, product velocity slowing | Balance optimization with innovation investment |
| **Segment confusion** | Unclear which segments get which resources and motion | Conflicting priorities, resource allocation fights | Clear segment definitions and resource allocation |
| **Key person dependency** | Efficiency concentrated in individuals, not systems | "Only Sarah knows how to..." | Document and systematize |
| **Technical debt** | Tech stack customization creating maintenance burden | Admin overload, integration fragility | Governance and standardization |

## Early Warning Indicators

- Efficiency metrics plateauing despite investment
- Team satisfaction declining
- Decision speed slowing
- Customer feedback mentioning friction
- Top performers leaving for smaller companies ("too slow here")
