---

### Task List: (Rules of Engagement Design) 1. Discovery & Design
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Audit Current State and Pain Points | 2h | Assess existing ROE documentation (if any) and identify current ownership conflicts and pain points. End state: Gap analysis showing what rules exist, what's missing, and quantified conflict frequency.<br /><br />• Review any existing ROE documentation, wiki pages, or tribal knowledge<br />• Pull data on ownership disputes from past 90 days (Slack threads, manager escalations, Salesforce reassignments)<br />• Interview 2-3 sales leaders on most common conflict scenarios<br />• Interview 3-5 sales reps to understand frontline frustrations<br />• Document which scenarios cause the most friction (inbound overlap, account poaching, partner conflicts)<br />• Quantify the problem: number of disputes per month, time spent resolving, deals lost to confusion |
| 2. Map All ROE Scenarios | 1.5h | Create comprehensive list of all scenarios requiring rules of engagement coverage. End state: Complete scenario matrix organized by deal type and lifecycle stage.<br /><br />• List inbound lead scenarios (form fills, demo requests, content downloads, event leads)<br />• List outbound prospecting scenarios (cold outreach to net-new accounts, named accounts, existing customer subsidiaries)<br />• List existing customer scenarios (upsell/cross-sell, expansion within parent/child hierarchies)<br />• List partner/channel scenarios (partner-sourced leads, co-selling, deal registration)<br />• List edge cases: dormant opportunities, recycled leads, ownership timeouts, segment changes<br />• Prioritize scenarios by frequency and conflict potential |
| 3. Define Core Ownership Rules | 2h | Establish the fundamental rules for account and opportunity ownership across all scenarios. End state: Draft ownership rules covering who owns what and for how long.<br /><br />• Define account ownership criteria (first touch, named account assignment, territory-based)<br />• Set opportunity ownership rules (who creates opp, who advances opp, splits for handoffs)<br />• Establish ownership duration limits (30/60/90 day windows for inactive opps)<br />• Define criteria for ownership transfer (stage gates, inactivity thresholds)<br />• Document parent-child account rules (subsidiary ownership follows parent vs. independent)<br />• Create clear rules for segment handoffs (SMB to MM, MM to Enterprise) |
| 4. Draft Scenario-Specific ROE | 2h | Write specific, actionable rules for each mapped scenario with examples. End state: Draft ROE document with rules for every identified scenario.<br /><br />• Write inbound lead ownership rules (round-robin vs. territory-based vs. account-matched)<br />• Write outbound prospecting rules (named account protections, cooling-off periods)<br />• Write upsell/expansion rules (AE vs. CSM vs. AM ownership boundaries)<br />• Write partner deal rules (deal registration windows, sourced vs. influenced credit)<br />• Include 2-3 concrete examples per rule to reduce interpretation ambiguity<br />• Use if/then language: "IF [condition], THEN [owner] owns for [duration]" |
| 5. Define Escalation and Dispute Resolution | 1.5h | Establish clear processes for handling disputes and edge cases. End state: Documented escalation path with decision-makers and SLAs.<br /><br />• Define first-line dispute resolution (rep-to-rep conversation with 24hr window)<br />• Establish manager escalation process (Sales Manager as first arbiter)<br />• Define final arbiter role (typically VP Sales or RevOps Lead)<br />• Set SLAs for dispute resolution (24-48 hours max)<br />• Document split mechanisms for legitimate overlap (percentage splits, double-comp scenarios)<br />• Create appeal process for edge cases not covered by rules |

### Task List: (Rules of Engagement Design) 2. Review & Implementation
**Contains:** Parts 3-4

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 6. Review with Sales Leadership | 2h | Present draft ROE to sales leadership for feedback, refinement, and approval. End state: Leadership-approved ROE document ready for team rollout.<br /><br />• Schedule review session with VP Sales and Sales Managers (60-90 min)<br />• Walk through each scenario category and proposed rules<br />• Stress-test rules against historical disputes (would this rule have resolved it?)<br />• Gather feedback on edge cases and unclear language<br />• Document all requested changes and rationale<br />• Revise draft and get final sign-off from VP Sales |
| 7. Get Team Buy-In and Communicate | 1.5h | Roll out final ROE to sales team with clear communication and acknowledgment. End state: All reps have read, understood, and acknowledged ROE.<br /><br />• Create executive summary (1-pager) of key rules for quick reference<br />• Schedule team-wide ROE rollout meeting (30-45 min)<br />• Walk through major rules with examples and rationale<br />• Address questions and concerns from reps<br />• Have all reps sign/acknowledge they've read and understood ROE<br />• Store final document in accessible location (wiki, Notion, Google Drive) |
| 8. Configure CRM Enforcement Settings | 2h | Implement CRM configurations that support and enforce ROE where possible. End state: CRM settings aligned with ROE for automated enforcement.<br /><br />• Configure ownership timeout automation (reassign inactive opps after X days)<br />• Set up validation rules to prevent unauthorized ownership changes<br />• Configure alerts for potential ROE violations (duplicate outreach to same account)<br />• Build report/dashboard showing ownership disputes and resolution<br />• Test automation with sample scenarios before enabling<br />• Document all CRM configurations for future maintenance |
| 9. Create Monitoring Plan and Hand Off | 1.5h | Establish ongoing monitoring process and transfer ownership to client team. End state: Client self-sufficient with ROE monitoring and update cadence.<br /><br />• Define ROE review cadence (quarterly recommended)<br />• Assign ROE owner within client organization (typically RevOps or Sales Ops)<br />• Create dispute tracking log/report for ongoing monitoring<br />• Document process for proposing ROE changes as organization evolves<br />• Transfer all documentation to client (ROE doc, CRM configs, monitoring reports)<br />• Schedule 30-day check-in to review initial effectiveness |
