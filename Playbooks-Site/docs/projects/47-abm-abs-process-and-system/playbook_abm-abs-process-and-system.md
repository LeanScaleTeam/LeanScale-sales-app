# ABM / ABS Process and System - Playbook

## 1. Definition

**What it is**: A strategic and technical implementation project that establishes an Account-Based Marketing (ABM) and Account-Based Sales (ABS) motion, aligning marketing and sales teams around a shared set of high-value target accounts. It includes defining ICP criteria, building target account lists, segmenting buying committees, integrating an ABM platform (such as 6sense or Demandbase), and orchestrating personalized multichannel campaigns.

**What it is NOT**: Not a general demand generation or inbound marketing project (those cast a wide net). Not a CRM implementation (assumes CRM exists). Not a sales engagement platform implementation (that's sequencing/cadences). Not a lead scoring project (though may inform one). Not brand marketing or awareness campaigns.

## 2. ICP Value Proposition

**Pain it solves**: Sales and marketing teams are wasting resources on accounts that will never close. Marketing generates leads that sales ignores. Sales pursues accounts that don't fit the ICP. There's no shared view of which accounts matter most, no coordinated engagement strategy, and no visibility into account-level intent or engagement signals.

**Outcome delivered**: A fully operational ABM/ABS motion with defined ICP criteria, prioritized target account list, buying committee mapping, integrated ABM platform with intent data, and coordinated multichannel campaign execution. Marketing and sales aligned on shared accounts, metrics, and engagement playbooks. Target accounts move through pipeline 2-3x faster with higher conversion rates.

**Who owns it**: VP of Marketing or VP of Sales Operations, with joint ownership between CMO and CRO. RevOps Leader typically drives implementation.

## 3. Implementation Procedure

### Part 1: Assess Current State & Define Strategy

- Pull data on win rates by account segment/size over last 12 months
- Document current tech stack capabilities for account-based targeting
- Identify gaps between current state and ABM best practices

## 4. Dependencies & Inputs

**What must exist before starting:**
- CRM (Salesforce or HubSpot) with clean account and contact data
- Marketing automation platform configured and operational
- Sales engagement platform in place (Outreach, Salesloft, or similar)
- Historical sales data (12-24 months of closed-won/lost deals)
- Budget allocated for ABM platform licensing and advertising spend
- Executive sponsorship from both sales and marketing leadership

**What client must provide:**
- Access to CRM with admin permissions for integration
- Historical win/loss data and deal analysis
- Sales team availability for ICP validation and training
- Marketing team availability for campaign execution training
- List of existing target accounts or strategic accounts (if any)
- Competitive landscape and key differentiators
- Budget range for ABM platform and ongoing ad spend
- Decision-maker availability for platform selection approval

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- **Pitfall 1: Jumping to execution without alignment** - Teams rush to launch campaigns before getting leadership buy-in and cross-functional agreement. ABM programs take 6-12 months to show ROI; without patience and support, they get killed prematurely. → **Mitigation**: Complete alignment phase thoroughly, set realistic timeline expectations, and establish governance before any campaign work.

- **Pitfall 2: Poor data quality undermines targeting** - Target account lists built on incomplete or inaccurate data lead to wasted ad spend and sales effort on wrong accounts. Disconnected account hierarchies cause attribution problems. → **Mitigation**: Invest in data enrichment upfront, validate ICP with sales input, and establish ongoing data hygiene processes.

- **Pitfall 3: Sales jumps on accounts too early** - Sales sees first intent signal and immediately calls, violating the ABM principle of coordinated engagement at the right time. → **Mitigation**: Train sales on ABM timing discipline, define clear score thresholds for sales engagement, and create "do not contact yet" rules.

- **Pitfall 4: Siloed execution between marketing and sales** - Marketing runs campaigns without sales coordination, or sales pursues accounts without marketing air cover. No single source of truth on account engagement. → **Mitigation**: Establish weekly ABM syncs, create shared dashboards, and define clear SLAs for handoffs and follow-up.

- **Pitfall 5: Trying to do full-scale ABM immediately** - Attempting 1:1 personalization for 500 accounts simultaneously overwhelms teams and dilutes impact. → **Mitigation**: Start with pilot on 10-20 Tier 1 accounts, learn and optimize, then scale to broader list.

## 6. Success Metrics

- **Leading Indicator**: Target account engagement rate (% of accounts showing multi-channel engagement within 30 days of campaign launch), buying committee coverage (% of accounts with 3+ contacts identified and engaged)

- **Lagging Indicator**: Pipeline generated from target accounts ($ value), conversion rate from target account to opportunity (vs. non-target accounts), average deal size for target account wins, revenue closed from target accounts within 6-12 months
