End state: Bottoms-up forecast showing what needs to be true to hit each quarter's target.<br /><br />• Work backward from quarterly ARR targets to required closed-won deals by segment<br />• Calculate pipeline coverage needed (typically 3-4x for predictable forecasting)<br />• Determine required opportunity volume based on historical win rates<br />• Model lead volume requirements based on MQL-to-Opp conversion rates<br />• Factor in average sales cycle length for timing of pipeline generation<br />• Reconcile bottoms-up requirements against current capacity |
| 7. Model Capacity Requirements | 2.5h | Determine rep count, ramp assumptions, and resource needs by quarter to support revenue targets. End state: Capacity plan showing hiring needs and productivity assumptions.<br /><br />• Calculate quota capacity based on current fully-ramped rep count<br />• Model new hire requirements based on target attainment assumptions<br />• Factor in ramp time (typically 3-6 months to full productivity)<br />• Calculate implied rep productivity and compare to benchmarks<br />• Identify capacity gaps by quarter<br />• Document hiring timeline implications |
| 8. Build ARR Momentum Table | 3h | Create monthly ARR tracking table that breaks out New, Expansion, Contraction, and Churned ARR. End state: ARR waterfall showing path from current to target ARR.<br /><br />• Set up monthly columns for trailing 12 months plus forecast period<br />• Break out ARR components: Starting ARR, New ARR, Expansion, Contraction, Churn, Ending ARR<br />• Apply NRR assumptions to existing customer base<br />• Model expansion revenue based on historical upsell rates<br />• Calculate net new ARR required each month<br />• Validate ending ARR matches quarterly targets |
| 9. Build Scenario Models | 3.5h | Create base, upside, and conservative scenarios with sensitivity analysis on key drivers. End state: Three scenario views showing range of outcomes based on different assumptions.<br /><br />• Duplicate base model for upside and conservative scenarios<br />• Identify 3-4 key driver variables for sensitivity (win rate, cycle length, churn, ACV)<br />• Model upside case with optimistic but achievable assumptions<br />• Model conservative case with current-state assumptions plus headwinds<br />• Create sensitivity table showing ARR impact of +/- 10% on each key driver<br />• Build scenario comparison summary for leadership presentation |
