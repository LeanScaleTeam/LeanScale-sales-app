## Customer Success Processes

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Customer Success at Optimize is about segment specialization, predictive health scoring, and scaled expansion. CS Platform is essential. Processes are systematized with playbooks. The focus shifts from "keeping customers happy" to "driving net revenue retention."

## Onboarding

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Segment-specific onboarding with clear success milestones. Enterprise gets high-touch, SMB gets digital-first. Onboarding efficiency is measured and optimized.

**Onboarding by segment:**

| Segment | Model | Ownership | Timeline | Key Milestones |
|---------|-------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Enterprise** | High-touch, dedicated | Named CSM + Implementation team | 60-120 days | Kickoff → Config → Training → Adoption → Expansion plan |
| **Mid-Market** | Scaled, guided | Pooled CSM | 30-60 days | Kickoff → Setup → Go-live → 30-day check-in |
| **SMB** | Digital-first | Tech-touch + CSM escalation | 14-30 days | Welcome → Self-serve setup → Activation milestone |

**Onboarding efficiency metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Signal |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Time to value** | Segment-appropriate | Onboarding working |
| **Onboarding completion rate** | >90% | Process completion |
| **Early churn (under 90 days)** | Under 5% | Onboarding quality |
| **Activation rate** | >85% | Setup success |
| **CSM time per onboarding** | Decreasing | Efficiency improving |

**Onboarding automation at Optimize:**

| Component | Automation Level |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Welcome workflows** | Fully automated by segment |
| **Setup guidance** | Digital guides + in-app |
| **Training** | Self-serve + live sessions by segment |
| **Milestone tracking** | Automated, surfaced in CS platform |
| **Handoff from sales** | Platform-triggered, automated data transfer |

**What NOT to do:**
- **Same onboarding for all segments** — wastes resources, leaves gaps
- **No onboarding metrics** — can't improve what isn't measured
- **CSM-only onboarding** — combine human + digital for efficiency

## Success Metrics / Health Scoring

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Predictive health scoring with segment-specific models. Health scores drive automated actions and CSM prioritization. Data is mature enough for meaningful prediction.

**Health scoring model at Optimize:**

| Input Category | Example Signals | Weight Guidance |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Product usage** | DAU/WAU ratio, feature adoption, depth of use | 30-40% |
| **Engagement** | CSM interactions, support tickets, training completion | 20-25% |
| **Business outcomes** | Reported value, ROI achieved | 20-25% |
| **Relationship** | NPS, champion access, executive engagement | 15-20% |
| **Contract signals** | Renewal timeline, expansion indicators, risk flags | 10-15% |

**Health score actions:**

| Health Level | Automated Actions | CSM Actions |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Green (75-100)** | Expansion nudges, advocacy asks | Quarterly business reviews, expansion conversations |
| **Yellow (50-75)** | Engagement campaigns, CSM alert | Proactive outreach, usage review |
| **Red (under 50)** | Urgent CSM notification, escalation workflow | Intervention playbook, executive involvement |

**Predictive elements at Optimize:**

| Prediction | Data Required | Use Case |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Churn risk** | Historical churn patterns + current signals | Prioritize intervention |
| **Expansion propensity** | Usage patterns + similar customer behavior | Prioritize expansion outreach |
| **Engagement drop** | Trend analysis on activity | Early warning |
| **Champion departure** | Title changes, contact activity | Relationship protection |

**What NOT to do:**
- **Static health scores** — scores should evolve with data
- **Too many inputs** — more signals ≠ better prediction
- **Ignoring false positives** — calibrate and refine continuously
- **CSM override without tracking** — track when humans disagree with model

## Product Feedback

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Product feedback integrates with roadmap process. Not just "collecting feedback" but "routing feedback to decisions." Customer Advisory Board (CAB) formalizes strategic input.

**Feedback infrastructure at Optimize:**

| Channel | Purpose | Routing |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **In-app feedback** | Feature requests, bugs | Product team (with tagging) |
| **CSM collected** | Strategic needs, pain points | Product + CS leadership |
| **Support tickets** | Issues, enhancement requests | Product (triaged by severity/frequency) |
| **CAB meetings** | Strategic direction, validation | Product leadership + Exec team |
| **NPS verbatims** | Sentiment drivers | Product + CS (for follow-up) |

**Customer Advisory Board at Optimize:**

| Element | What It Looks Like |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Composition** | 10-15 strategic customers, mix of segments |
| **Cadence** | Quarterly meetings, annual summit |
| **Topics** | Roadmap preview, strategic direction, beta programs |
| **Value exchange** | Early access, influence, executive relationships |
| **Governance** | Clear charter, NDA, executive sponsorship |

**Feedback-to-roadmap connection:**

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **Collection** | Feedback captured with context, tagged |
| **Aggregation** | Product team groups by theme, frequency |
| **Prioritization** | Revenue impact, strategic fit, effort |
| **Communication** | Close loop with customers who provided feedback |

**What NOT to do:**
- **Black hole feedback** — customers should see their input matters
- **CAB as sales channel** — advisory boards are for input, not upselling
- **Ignoring segment patterns** — enterprise vs SMB may have different needs

**Playbook reference:** → NPS and Voice of Customer Launch (feedback section)

## Renewal Process

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Platform-supported renewal process with automated triggers. Renewals are not events but outcomes of the entire customer relationship. Clear ownership and timeline.

**Renewal process at Optimize:**

| Timeline | Activity | Owner |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **-120 days** | Renewal workflow triggered, risk assessment | CS Platform (automated) |
| **-90 days** | CSM outreach, business review scheduled | CSM |
| **-60 days** | Business review completed, renewal proposal | CSM + Renewal Manager |
| **-45 days** | Commercial negotiation, expansion discussion | Renewal Manager / AE |
| **-30 days** | Contract sent, signature process | Renewal Manager |
| **-14 days** | Escalation if not signed | CS Leadership |
| **Renewal date** | Contract executed or churn processed | Legal/Ops |

**Renewal team structure:**

| Model | When to Use | Ownership |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| **CSM owns renewal** | SMB, simple renewals | CSM end-to-end |
| **Renewal Manager** | Mid-market, volume renewals | Dedicated renewal team |
| **AE involvement** | Enterprise, expansion attached | AE + CSM collaboration |

**Renewal metrics at Optimize:**

| Metric | Target | Signal |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Gross retention** | >90% (segment-appropriate) | Base business health |
| **Net retention** | >110% | Growth from existing customers |
| **On-time renewal rate** | >95% | Process efficiency |
| **Renewal cycle time** | Decreasing | Process optimization |
| **Logo churn** | Under 10% | Customer loss |

**What NOT to do:**
- **Last-minute renewals** — start 120+ days out
- **Renewal without health context** — risk should be addressed before renewal conversation
- **Missing expansion opportunity** — renewal is expansion moment

**Playbook reference:** → Renewal, Churn, NRR, GRR Reporting

## Expansion & Upsell

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Expansion is a process with playbooks, not opportunistic. Dedicated expansion capacity (Account Managers or structured CSM time). Clear handoff between CSM identification and AE/AM close.

**Expansion program structure:**

| Element | What It Looks Like |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Expansion triggers** | Usage thresholds, success milestones, contract anniversaries |
| **Expansion playbooks** | By expansion type (seats, features, tier upgrade) |
| **Ownership model** | CSM identifies, AM/AE closes (or CSM closes small expansions) |
| **Expansion forecasting** | Expansion pipeline tracked, forecasted |
| **Comp alignment** | CSMs incentivized on expansion (carefully designed) |

**Expansion playbooks:**

| Expansion Type | Trigger | Playbook |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| **Seat expansion** | Usage at capacity, department interest | Land-and-expand playbook |
| **Tier upgrade** | Feature usage, advanced needs | Value demonstration + ROI |
| **Add-on products** | Use case fit, customer request | Cross-sell with integration |
| **Multi-year** | Renewal timing, relationship strength | Discount for commitment |

**Expansion metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Signal |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Expansion revenue** | Increasing % of total | Expansion program health |
| **Expansion win rate** | >50% | Playbook effectiveness |
| **Time to expand** | Decreasing | Efficiency |
| **Expansion by source** | CSM vs Marketing vs Product-led | Channel effectiveness |

**What NOT to do:**
- **CSM as quota-carrying AE** — balance growth and retention
- **No expansion pipeline** — can't forecast what isn't tracked
- **Expansion pressure on unhealthy accounts** — fix health first

## Reference & Testimonial

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Advocacy program replaces ad-hoc reference requests. Structured program with tiers, benefits, and asks. Reference capacity is measured and managed.

**Advocacy program at Optimize:**

| Tier | Customers | Activities | Benefits |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Advocate** | ~50-100 | References, reviews, peer calls | Swag, recognition, early access |
| **Champion** | ~20-30 | Case studies, speaking, CAB | Executive access, roadmap input |
| **Ambassador** | ~5-10 | Co-marketing, major speaking | Partnership benefits, co-investment |

**Reference capacity management:**

| Element | What's Tracked |
|---------|---------------|
| **Reference availability** | Active references by segment, use case, industry |
| **Reference utilization** | Asks per reference, fatigue monitoring |
| **Reference effectiveness** | Win rate with reference vs without |
| **Reference pipeline** | Upcoming advocates, onboarding to program |

**Testimonial assets at Optimize:**

| Asset Type | Volume Target | Use Case |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Case studies** | 15-25 | Sales, marketing, website |
| **Video testimonials** | 5-10 | Website, events, social |
| **G2/Capterra reviews** | 100+ reviews | Buyer research |
| **Quotes** | 50+ | Collateral, slides |
| **Speaking customers** | 10-15 | Events, webinars |

**What NOT to do:**
- **Over-asking top advocates** — fatigue damages relationships
- **No advocate pipeline** — always recruiting new advocates
- **Ignoring advocacy in success planning** — build advocacy into customer journey

## Support

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Tiered support with segment-specific SLAs. Support is a strategic function, not just ticket resolution. Support insights feed product and CS.

**Support structure at Optimize:**

| Tier | Scope | SLA Target |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Tier 1** | Basic issues, how-to, known issues | Under 4 hours response |
| **Tier 2** | Complex issues, configuration, troubleshooting | Under 8 hours response |
| **Tier 3** | Engineering escalation, bugs, advanced issues | Under 24 hours response |
| **Premium Support** | Named support (enterprise), priority SLAs | Under 1-2 hours response |

**Support by segment:**

| Segment | Support Model | SLA |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Enterprise** | Named support contact, priority queue | 1-hour response, 4-hour resolution target |
| **Mid-Market** | Prioritized queue, CSM escalation path | 4-hour response, 8-hour resolution target |
| **SMB** | Standard queue, self-serve first | 8-hour response, 24-hour resolution target |

**Support efficiency metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Signal |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **First response time** | Within SLA | Capacity alignment |
| **Resolution time** | Within target | Efficiency |
| **First contact resolution** | >70% | Self-serve + training effectiveness |
| **CSAT** | >90% | Quality |
| **Ticket volume per customer** | Decreasing | Product quality + training |

**Support-to-product loop:**

| Element | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| **Bug triage** | Support categorizes, product prioritizes |
| **Feature requests** | Tagged, aggregated, reported to product |
| **Knowledge gaps** | Identifies doc/training needs |
| **Escalation patterns** | Signals systemic issues |

**What NOT to do:**
- **Support as cost center only** — support is strategic insight source
- **SLA without action** — missed SLAs need consequences and improvement
- **Ignoring self-serve** — documentation reduces ticket volume

## CS Platform

**Stage-appropriate approach:** CS Platform is essential at Optimize. The platform is the system of record for customer health, playbooks, and CS operations. Integration with CRM is tight.

**CS Platform requirements at Optimize:**

| Capability | What's Needed |
|------------|--------------|
| **Health scoring** | Automated health scores from multiple inputs |
| **Playbook automation** | Triggered workflows based on health, lifecycle stage |
| **Renewal management** | Renewal tracking, forecasting, workflow |
| **Integration** | CRM, support, product usage data |
| **Reporting** | CSM dashboards, leadership reporting, customer 360 |
| **Task management** | CSM workload, prioritization, efficiency |

**CS Platform options at Optimize:**

| Category | Tools | Best For |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Enterprise** | Gainsight, Totango, ChurnZero | 200+ customers, complex health scoring |
| **Mid-Market** | Vitally, Catalyst, ChurnZero | 100-500 customers, integrated approach |
| **Startup** | HubSpot Service Hub, Planhat | Under 100 customers, simpler needs |

**CS Platform ROI at Optimize:**

| Benefit | How It Shows Up |
|---------|----------------|
| **Retention improvement** | Health scoring enables proactive intervention |
| **Expansion increase** | Expansion triggers and playbooks drive revenue |
| **CSM efficiency** | Automation reduces manual work |
| **Data quality** | Single source of truth for customer health |
| **Visibility** | Leadership has real-time customer portfolio view |

**Implementation considerations:**

| Factor | Guidance |
|--------|----------|
| **Data readiness** | Need clean CRM data + usage data before implementation |
| **Team readiness** | CSMs need training + buy-in |
| **Integration scope** | Start with CRM + usage, expand to support + product |
| **Rollout approach** | Pilot with segment, then expand |

**What NOT to do:**
- **Platform without process** — tool doesn't fix bad process
- **Too many integrations at once** — start simple, iterate
- **CSM resistance** — invest in training and change management
- **Ignoring data quality** — garbage in, garbage out
