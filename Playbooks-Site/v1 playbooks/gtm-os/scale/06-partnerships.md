## Partnerships

**Stage-appropriate approach:** Partnerships become strategic at Scale. Technology partnerships are active. Channel partnership conversations start but formal programs are typically Optimize stage. The focus is building integration depth with key partners.

## Partnership Types at Scale

| Partnership Type | Relevance | Investment |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| **Technology integrations** | High — active | Building depth |
| **Technology alliances** | Medium — strategic | Selected partners |
| **Channel partners** | Low-Medium — exploratory | Conversations, not programs |
| **Strategic alliances** | Low — premature | Rare exception |

## Technology Partnerships

**What makes sense at Scale:**

- **Core integrations** — build integrations with platforms customers use daily
- **Ecosystem presence** — be in the marketplaces that matter (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
- **Co-marketing** — joint webinars, content, case studies with strategic partners
- **Sales alignment** — warm intros, co-selling on shared opportunities

**Integration prioritization:**

| Criteria | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Customer demand | High — "do you integrate with X?" |
| Competitive requirement | High — table stakes in the category |
| Strategic value | Medium — opens new segments |
| Partner interest | Medium — bidirectional value |

**Partnership roles at Scale:**

- **BD/Partnerships lead** — often first dedicated role, may be split with other functions
- **Solutions engineering** — technical integration work, often shared with product
- **Partner marketing** — co-marketing execution, often in marketing

## Channel Partnership Exploration

At Scale, channel conversations start but formal programs wait:

| Activity | Scale Stage | Optimize Stage |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Identify potential partners | Yes | — |
| Have exploratory conversations | Yes | — |
| Test with 1-2 partners | Maybe | Yes |
| Build partner portal | No | Yes |
| Launch formal program | No | Yes |
| Hire partner team | No | Yes |

**What NOT to do:**

- **Build channel program too early** — infrastructure without scale wastes resources
- **Ignore ecosystem** — integration requests are market signals
- **Over-promise to partners** — partnerships require investment to maintain
- **Equal time for all partners** — prioritize ruthlessly by strategic value
