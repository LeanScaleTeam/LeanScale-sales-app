# Growth Model Segmentations

Segmentation is about understanding your customer base and breaking it down into groups that are similar in meaningful ways.

## Segmentation Methods

### 1. Firmographics

Analyze company traits including size, sector, and location to identify performance patterns across different business profiles.

Key firmographic factors:
- Company size (employees, revenue)
- Industry vertical
- Geographic location
- Company stage (startup, growth, enterprise)

### 2. Geographic Information

Break down your customer base by location to account for regional variations in sales patterns and conversion rates.

Consider:
- Regional buying behaviors
- Local competition
- Time zone implications for sales coverage
- Currency and pricing variations

### 3. Sector

Categorize by industry to understand performance differences. For example, financial institutions may have longer sales cycles and more red tape, while e-commerce or tech companies may be more agile.

Industry-specific considerations:
- Sales cycle length
- Decision-making complexity
- Budget cycles
- Compliance requirements

### 4. Product

For multi-product businesses, segmenting by product helps track individual product performance across different markets.

Product segmentation enables:
- Individual product revenue tracking
- Cross-sell and upsell opportunity identification
- Product-market fit analysis

## Aligning Growth Model to Segmentation

Once customers are grouped, customize your go-to-market strategies to fit each segment:

| Function | Customization Approach |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Marketing** | Tailor campaigns and messaging to segment needs |
| **Sales** | Adjust pitches and processes for each segment |
| **Customer Success** | Customize onboarding and support strategies |

## Benefits of Segmentation

By segmenting your customer base and aligning your growth model accordingly, you can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of your marketing, sales, and customer success efforts.
