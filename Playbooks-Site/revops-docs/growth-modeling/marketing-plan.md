# Marketing Plan

This guide provides a comprehensive approach to constructing a data-driven marketing plan aligned with revenue goals. The core premise focuses on generating the right number of sales-qualified leads (SQLs) to hit bookings targets.

## 1. Understanding the SQL Target

The foundation involves determining the number of SQLs required to hit your revenue targets. This is your closed-won marketing target that guides all marketing initiatives.

### Calculate Your SQL Target

```
Required SQLs = Target Bookings / (Average Deal Size x SQL-to-Close Rate)
```

## 2. Channel Distribution and Efficiency Expectations

After establishing SQL targets, marketing leaders should allocate these leads across various marketing channels:

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Paid Advertising** | SEM, social ads, display |
| **Events** | Conferences, webinars, trade shows |
| **Website Traffic** | Organic, SEO, content marketing |
| **Sales Referrals** | Leads from sales team prospecting |
| **Customer Success Referrals** | Referrals from existing customers |
| **Partnerships** | Channel and alliance partners |

Set specific targets and efficiency metrics for each channel.

## 3. Cost per Sales Qualified Lead

Calculate cost per SQL by dividing historical marketing budget by SQLs generated per channel:

```
Cost per SQL = Channel Marketing Spend / SQLs Generated
```

This metric enables optimization of budget allocation across campaigns. Focus investment on channels with the best cost per SQL while maintaining diversification.

## 4. Marketing Calendar and Timing

Marketing initiatives require lead time before generating SQLs, similar to sales ramp periods.

### Key Timing Considerations

- **Campaign lead time** - Planning and execution time before results
- **Sales cycle alignment** - Ensure leads arrive when sales can work them
- **Seasonal factors** - Account for budget cycles and buying patterns

Aligning marketing timelines with sales cycles ensures consistent lead flow.

## 5. Constructing a Marketing Plan

Build a practical quarterly model showing:

1. **Q1-Q4 Bookings Targets** - Revenue goals by quarter
2. **SQL Calculations** - Required SQLs based on conversion rates
3. **Channel Allocation** - Distribution across marketing channels
4. **Budget Requirements** - Investment needed per channel

### Example Framework

| Quarter | Bookings Target | Required SQLs | Marketing Budget |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|
| Q1 | $500K | 250 | $75K |
| Q2 | $600K | 300 | $90K |
| Q3 | $700K | 350 | $105K |
| Q4 | $800K | 400 | $120K |

Include a fifth quarter (Q5) for forward planning and continuous pipeline generation.
