### Task List: (Quotas and Target Setting) 1. Assessment & Model Building
**Contains:** Parts 1-2

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Pull and Analyze Historical Sales Data | 2h | Extract 12-24 months of CRM sales data to establish baseline performance metrics and identify patterns. End state: Comprehensive data set ready for quota modeling with documented performance trends by rep and territory.<br /><br />• Export closed-won deals from CRM for past 12-24 months including deal size, close date, and rep assignment<br />• Calculate key metrics by rep: win rate, average deal size, sales cycle length, and total bookings<br />• Segment data by territory to identify regional performance variations<br />• Document conversion rates at each pipeline stage (opportunity-to-close rates)<br />• Flag any data quality issues (missing rep assignments, incomplete territory tags) for cleanup |
| 2. Document Top-Down Revenue Targets and Constraints | 1.5h | Interview executive stakeholders to capture approved revenue targets and any known constraints for the quota period. End state: Clear documentation of company-level ARR goals and strategic priorities that quotas must support.<br /><br />• Schedule kickoff meeting with VP of Sales and CRO to capture annual/quarterly revenue targets<br />• Document growth expectations (percentage increase vs. prior period)<br />• Identify any planned territory or market changes that affect quota allocation<br />• Confirm approved headcount plan including new hire start dates<br />• Capture any executive constraints (e.g., minimum quota floors, maximum territory sizes) |
| 3. Audit Current Quota Methodology | 2h | Evaluate the existing quota-setting process to identify gaps and improvement opportunities. End state: Gap analysis documenting what works, what doesn't, and recommended methodology changes.<br /><br />• Review current quota documentation and historical quota files<br />• Identify how quotas were previously set (top-down only, bottom-up, or blended)<br />• Assess whether territory weighting was applied and if methodology was transparent<br />• Interview 2-3 reps on pain points with current quotas (fairness, attainability, clarity)<br />• Document gaps: arbitrary increases, missing ramp schedules, territory imbalances |
| 4. Calculate Territory Weighting Factors | 2.5h | Develop weighting factors that ensure equivalent opportunity across territories regardless of market size or maturity. End state: Territory scoring model with documented weights based on account density, market potential, and historical performance.<br /><br />• Define weighting criteria: account density, market maturity, competitive intensity, historical win rates<br />• Score each territory on a 1-5 scale for each criterion<br />• Calculate composite territory weight (e.g., Manhattan territory = 1.3x, rural territory = 0.7x)<br />• Validate weights with sales leadership to ensure they reflect reality on the ground<br />• Document the methodology for transparency during rollout |
| 5. Build the Blended Quota Model | 3.5h | Create the core quota allocation spreadsheet combining top-down targets with bottom-up capacity analysis. End state: Working quota model showing individual rep quotas with supporting calculations.<br /><br />• Start with top-down revenue target and work down to rep-level allocation<br />• Apply territory weighting factors to adjust for market potential differences<br />• Build bottom-up validation using historical performance and capacity (pipeline coverage × win rate)<br />• Reconcile top-down and bottom-up to create blended quota per rep<br />• Include quota breakdown by revenue type if needed (new business, expansion, renewal) |
| 6. Create Role and Segment Variations | 2.5h | Segment quotas appropriately for different sales roles, motions, and market segments. End state: Quota model reflects role-specific targets (AE vs SDR vs AM) and segment-specific realities (SMB vs Enterprise).<br /><br />• Define quota approach for each role type: AE (bookings), SDR (pipeline/meetings), AM (expansion/renewal)<br />• Adjust quotas for segment differences (SMB shorter cycles and smaller deals vs. Enterprise)<br />• Apply product-based weighting if reps carry multiple products (e.g., 60% core, 25% add-ons, 15% services)<br />• Validate that quota-to-OTE ratio falls within target range (typically 4-6x for B2B SaaS field sales)<br />• Document any exceptions and the rationale behind them |
| 7. Build Ramp Schedules for New Hires | 2h | Create explicit ramp schedules showing quota expectations for new hires at 30/60/90 days. End state: Ramp schedule table included in quota model with prorated quotas for all planned new hires.<br /><br />• Define ramp timeline based on average time-to-productivity (typically 3-6 months for B2B SaaS)<br />• Create milestone expectations: Month 1 (25% quota), Month 2 (50%), Month 3 (75%), Month 4+ (100%)<br />• Apply ramp schedules to each planned new hire based on start date<br />• Calculate impact on team quota coverage (ramping reps contribute partial quota)<br />• Document how mid-period hires will be handled for quota adjustments |

### Task List: (Quotas and Target Setting) 2. Validation & Launch
**Contains:** Parts 3-4

| Task | Est | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 8. Back-Test Against Historical Data | 2h | Validate the proposed quota model by testing it against historical performance to confirm achievability. End state: Back-test analysis showing what percentage of reps would have hit quota under the new methodology.<br /><br />• Apply proposed quotas to prior period actual results (12-24 months)<br />• Calculate attainment rate: target is 70-80% of reps hitting quota<br />• Identify any reps who would have been significantly over or under quota<br />• Adjust model if back-test shows unrealistic attainment (too high = sandbagging, too low = demotivating)<br />• Document back-test results as evidence for methodology defensibility |
| 9. Conduct Scenario Analysis | 2h | Stress-test the model against different business scenarios to ensure robustness. End state: Scenario analysis showing quota implications under best-case, expected, and worst-case conditions.<br /><br />• Model best-case scenario: 20% upside on pipeline coverage<br />• Model worst-case scenario: 20% downside on win rates or deal sizes<br />• Assess impact on company revenue if attainment rates vary by +/- 10%<br />• Identify high-risk territories or reps where quota may be most sensitive<br />• Prepare talking points for leadership review meeting |
| 10. Obtain Stakeholder Approval | 1.5h | Present the quota model to sales leadership for review, feedback, and final approval. End state: Approved quota allocation with sign-off from VP of Sales/CRO.<br /><br />• Schedule quota review meeting with VP of Sales and RevOps leadership<br />• Walk through methodology: data sources, weighting factors, ramp schedules<br />• Present back-test results and scenario analysis as validation<br />• Capture feedback and iterate on specific rep/territory allocations if needed<br />• Obtain formal sign-off before proceeding to CRM configuration |
| 11. Configure CRM Quota Tracking | 3h | Set up quota data in CRM and build real-time attainment dashboards. End state: CRM reflects individual quotas with live attainment tracking visible to reps and managers.<br /><br />• Create custom quota fields in CRM (Salesforce or HubSpot) for annual and period quotas<br />• Load approved quota values for each rep/territory<br />• Build quota attainment dashboard showing: current bookings, quota, attainment %, gap to quota<br />• Configure visual indicators (red/yellow/green) for at-risk, on-track, and exceeding reps<br />• Test dashboard with sample data to ensure calculations are correct |
| 12. Conduct Quota Rollout Meeting | 1.5h | Present quotas to sales leadership and managers before broader communication to reps. End state: Leadership aligned and prepared to communicate quotas to their teams.<br /><br />• Schedule rollout meeting with sales managers and VP of Sales<br />• Walk through the methodology, data sources, and individual allocations<br />• Explain territory weighting logic and ramp schedules for new hires<br />• Provide managers with talking points for rep-level conversations<br />• Address questions and document any concerns for follow-up |
| 13. Communicate Quotas to Sales Team | 1.5h | Roll out quotas to individual reps with clear explanation of methodology and expectations. End state: Every rep understands their quota, how it was calculated, and where to track progress.<br /><br />• Create quota communication package explaining methodology and rationale<br />• Distribute individual quota letters or emails with rep-specific targets<br />• Host Q&A session (live or async) to address rep questions<br />• Provide access to CRM dashboard for self-service attainment tracking<br />• Document FAQs for ongoing reference |
| 14. Establish Review Cadence and Hand Off | 2.5h | Set up quarterly review process and transfer ownership to client RevOps. End state: Client self-sufficient with scheduled reviews and documentation for future quota cycles.<br /><br />• Schedule quarterly quota review meetings (RevOps + Sales Leadership)<br />• Define triggers for mid-period quota adjustments (territory changes, market shifts)<br />• Deliver documentation package: quota model spreadsheet, methodology runbook, CRM config notes<br />• Transfer admin access and ownership to client RevOps<br />• Schedule 30-day check-in to assess early attainment patterns |
