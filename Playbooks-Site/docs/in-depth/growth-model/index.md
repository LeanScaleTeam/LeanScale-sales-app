# Growth Model

**Project Type:** Financial Modeling & ARR Target Operationalization

Integrate top-down ARR targets with bottom-up GTM efficiency metrics to create achievable quarterly revenue goals and identify specific gaps to address.

## Key Concepts

- **Power 10 Metrics:** The 7-10 key efficiency metrics that drive 80% of GTM impact
- **Bottoms-Up Forecast:** Working backward from ARR targets to required inputs (leads, pipeline, capacity)
- **ARR Momentum:** Monthly tracking of New ARR, Expansion, Contraction, and Churn
- **Pipeline Coverage:** Required multiple of pipeline to target (typically 3-4x for predictable forecasting)
- **Rule of 40:** Growth rate + profit margin benchmark for efficient SaaS companies

## When to Use This Project

**Good fit:**
- Leadership has board-mandated ARR target but no clear line of sight to achieving it
- Targets feel arbitrary, gaps are unclear, resource allocation based on gut feel
- Need to demonstrate efficient growth (not growth at any cost) to VCs and boards
- Planning upcoming quarters and need to validate assumptions

**Prerequisites:**
- CRM with at least 12 months of closed-won deal data (ideally 18-24 months)
- Clear top-down ARR targets with quarterly breakdown
- Access to key stakeholder (CRO, VP Sales, or RevOps lead)
- Customer data to calculate NRR components

**Related Projects:**
- Territory Design (uses capacity planning outputs)
- Sales Process Optimization (addresses conversion rate gaps)
- Lead Generation Strategy (addresses volume gaps)
